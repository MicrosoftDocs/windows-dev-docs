# download command (winget)

The **download** command of the [winget](index.md) tool downloads the installer from the selected package. Use the [**search**](search.md) command and the [**show**](show.md) command to identify the package installer you want to download .

The **download** command requires that you specify the exact string to download. If there is any ambiguity, you will be prompted to further filter the **download** command to an exact application.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **download** command will download the appropriate installer to the user's Downloads folder. Use the **--download-directory** option to specify a custom download path.

> [!NOTE]
> As of March 2024, the download option does not support the msstore source.
