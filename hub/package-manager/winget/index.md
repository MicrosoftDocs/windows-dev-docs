# Use the winget tool to install and manage applications

The **winget** command line tool enables users to discover, install, upgrade, remove and configure applications on Windows 10 and Windows 11 computers. This tool is the client interface to the Windows Package Manager service.

## Install winget

Windows Package Manager **winget** command-line tool is bundled with Windows 11 and modern versions of Windows 10 by default as the **App Installer**.

If you are running an earlier version of Windows and the App Installer is not installed, you can [get App Installer from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1#activetab=pivot:overviewtab). If it's already installed, make sure it is updated with the latest version.

App Installer includes the production version of the winget tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The **winget** command line tool is only supported on Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later at this time.

### Install winget preview version [Developers Only]

To try the latest Windows Package Manager features, install the latest preview build of the **winget** command line tool in one of the following ways:

* Use a Microsoft Account (MSA), work, school or Azure Active Directory (AAD) account to sign up for the [Windows Insider Dev Channel](https://insider.windows.com/understand-flighting).

* Use a Microsoft Account (MSA) to sign up for the [Windows Package Manager Insiders Program](https://aka.ms/AppInstaller_InsiderProgram).

* Install the Windows Desktop App Installer package located on the [Releases page for the winget repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases). Installing this package will give you the WinGet client, but it will not enable automatic updates from the Microsoft Store.

### Install winget on Windows Sandbox

[Windows Sandbox](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview) provides a lightweight desktop environment to safely run applications in isolation. Software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains "sandboxed" and runs separately from the host machine. Windows Sandbox does not include winget, nor the Microsoft Store app, so you will need to download the latest winget package from the winget releases page on GitHub.

To install winget on Windows Sandbox, follow these steps from a Windows PowerShell command prompt:

```powershell
$ProgressPreference='Silent'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/download/v1.3.2691/Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.msixbundle -OutFile .\Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.msixbundle
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/Microsoft.VCLibs.x64.14.00.Desktop.appx -OutFile Microsoft.VCLibs.x64.14.00.Desktop.appx
Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.VCLibs.x64.14.00.Desktop.appx
Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.msixbundle
```

For more information on Windows Sandbox, including how to install a sandbox and what to expect from it's usage, see the [Windows Sandbox docs](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview).

## Administrator considerations

Installer behavior can be different depending on whether you are running **winget** with administrator privileges.

* When running **winget** without administrator privileges, some applications may [require elevation](/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) to install. When the installer runs, Windows will prompt you to [elevate](/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works). If you choose not to elevate, the application will fail to install.  

* When running **winget** in an Administrator Command Prompt, you will not see [elevation prompts](/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) if the application requires it. Always use caution when running your command prompt as an administrator, and only install applications you trust.

## Use winget

After **App Installer** is installed, you can run **winget** by typing 'winget' from a Command Prompt.

One of the most common usage scenarios is to search for and install a favorite tool.

1. To [search](./search.md) for a tool, type `winget search <appname>`.
2. After you have confirmed that the tool you want is available, you can [install](./install.md) the tool by typing `winget install <appname>`. The **winget** tool will launch the installer and install the application on your PC.

3. In addition to install and search, **winget** provides a number of other commands that enable you to [show details](show.md) on applications, [change sources](./source.md), and [validate packages](./validate.md). To get a complete list of commands, type: `winget --help`.

## Scripting winget

You can author batch scripts and PowerShell scripts to install multiple applications.

``` CMD
@echo off  
Echo Install Powertoys and Terminal  
REM Powertoys  
winget install Microsoft.Powertoys  
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 Echo Powertoys installed successfully.  
REM Terminal  
winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal  
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 Echo Terminal installed successfully.   %ERRORLEVEL%
```

> [!NOTE]
> When scripted, **winget** will launch the applications in the specified order. When an installer returns success or failure, **winget** will launch the next installer. If an installer launches another process, it is possible that it will return to **winget** prematurely. This will cause **winget** to install the next installer before the previous installer has completed.

## Debugging and troubleshooting

**winget** provides logging to help diagnose issues. For troubleshooting and details on logging, see [Debugging and troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).
