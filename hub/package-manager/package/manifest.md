# Create your package manifest

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../../includes/package-manager-preview.md)]

If you want to submit a software package to the [Windows Package Manager repository](repository.md), start by creating a package manifest. The manifest is a YAML file that describes the application to be installed.

This article describes the contents of a package manifest for Windows Package Manager.

## YAML basics

The YAML format was chosen for package manifests because of its relative ease of human readability and consistency with other Microsoft development tools. If you are not familiar with YAML syntax, you can learn the basics at [Learn YAML in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).

> [!NOTE]
> Manifests for Windows Package Manager currently do not support all YAML features. Unsupported YAML features include anchors, complex keys, and sets.

## Conventions

These conventions are used in this article:

* To the left of `:` is a literal keyword used in manifest definitions.
* To the right of `:` is a data type. The data type can be a primitive type like **string** or a reference to a rich structure defined elsewhere in this article.
* The notation `[` *datatype* `]` indicates an array of the mentioned data type. For example, `[ string ]` is an array of strings.
* The notation `{` *datatype* `:` *datatype* `}` indicates a mapping of one data type to another. For example, `{ string: string }` is a mapping of strings to strings.

## Manifest contents

A package manifest must include a set of required items, and can also include further optional items that can help improve the customer experience of installing your software. This section provides brief summaries of the required manifest schema and complete manifest schemas, and examples of each.

Each field in the manifest file must be Pascal-cased and cannot be duplicated.

For a complete list and descriptions of items in a manifest, see the [manifest specification](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/blob/master/doc/ManifestSpecv0.1.md) in the [https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) repository.

## Tips and best practices

* For the best customer experience when finding and installing your software, we recommend that you include as many optional items beyond the required schema as possible. For example, the `AppMoniker` field is optional. However, if you include this field, customers will see results associated with the `AppMoniker` value when performing the [search](../winget/search.md) command (for example, **vscode** for **Visual Studio Code**). If there is only one app with the specified `AppMoniker` value, customers can install your application by specifying the moniker rather than the fully qualified ID.
* The `Id` must be unique. You cannot have multiple submissions with the same package identifier. Avoid spaces, because this will require users to put quotation marks around the `Id` when using the [winget](../index.md) client.
* Avoid creating multiple publisher folders. For example, do not create "Contoso Ltd" if there is already a "Contoso" folder. Also avoid spaces when creating folders.
* All packages should be submitted with a silent install if possible. If you have an executable that does not support a silent install, the user experience will be diminished.
* Limit the length of strings in your manifest to 100 characters before a line break.
* When more than one installer type exists for the specified version of the package, an instance of `InstallerType` can be placed under each of the `Installers`.
