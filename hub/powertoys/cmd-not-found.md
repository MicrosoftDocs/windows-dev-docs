Import-Module "<powertoys install dir>/WinGetCommandNotFound.psd1"

```

**Note:** The profile file will be created if needed. Restart PowerShell session to use the module.

## Uninstalling Command Not Found

To uninstall the Command Not Found module, navigate to the Command Not Found page in PowerToys settings and select the **Uninstall** button. Once the module uninstall has completed, the block of commands previously added will be removed from the PowerShell profile file.
