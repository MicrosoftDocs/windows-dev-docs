# Environment Variables utility

Environment Variables offers an easy and convenient way to manage environment variables. It also allows you to create profiles for managing a set of variables together. Profile variables have precedence over User and System variables. Applying the profile adds variables to User environment variables in the background. When a profile is applied, if there is an existing User variable with the same name, a backup variable is created in User variables which will be reverted to the original value on profile un-apply.

Applied variables list shows the current state of the environment, respecting the order of evaluation of environment variables (Profile -> User -> System). Evaluated Path variable value is shown at the top of the list.
