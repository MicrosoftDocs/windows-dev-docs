## Plugins

PowerToys Run uses a plugin system to provide different types of results.

###  Plugin manager

The PowerToys Run settings menu includes a plugin manager that allows you to enable/disable the various available plugins. By selecting and expanding the sections, you can customize the direct activation commands used by each plugin. In addition, you can select whether a plugin appears in global results, as well as set additional plugin options where available.

### System commands

PowerToys Run enables a set of system level actions that can be executed.

| Action command / Search result | Action | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Shutdown` | Shuts down the computer | Can use localised keyword |
| `Restart` | Restarts the computer | Can use localised keyword |
| `Sign Out` | Signs current user out | Can use localised keyword |
| `Lock` | Locks the computer | Can use localised keyword |
| `Sleep` | Sleeps the computer | Can use localised keyword |
| `Hibernate` | Hibernates the computer | Can use localised keyword |
| `Empty Recycle Bin` | Empties the recycle bin | Can use localised keywords |
| `UEFI Firmware Settings` | Reboot computer into UEFI Firmware Settings | Only available on systems with UEFI firmware.<br />(Requires administrative permissions.) |
| `IP address` | Shows the ip addresses from the network connections of your computer. | The search query has to start with `IP` or `address`. |
| `MAC address` | Shows the mac addresses from the network adapters in your computer. | The search query has to start with `MAC` or `address`. |


### Program parameters

The PowerToys Run program plugin allows for program arguments to be added when launching an application. The program arguments must follow the expected format as defined by the program's command line interface.

> [!NOTE]
> To input valid search queries, the first element after the program name has to be one of the following possibilities:
> - The characters sequence `--`.
> - A parameter that starts with `-`.
> - A parameter that starts with `--`.
> - A parameter that starts with `/`.


For example, when launching Visual Studio Code, you can specify the folder to be opened with:

`Visual Studio Code -- C:\myFolder`

Visual Studio Code also supports a set of [command line parameters](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line), which can be utilized with their corresponding arguments in PowerToys Run to, for instance, view the difference between files:

`Visual Studio Code -d C:\foo.txt C:\bar.txt` 

If the program plugin's option "Include in global result" is not selected, be sure to include the activation phrase, `.` by default, to invoke the plugin's behavior:

`.Visual Studio Code -- C:\myFolder`

### Calculator Plugin

> [!NOTE]
> The calculator plugin respects the number format settings of your system. Please be aware of the different decimal and thousand delimiters in different locals.

> [!WARNING]
> There is a known issue that the comma sign used in some operations as delimiter between numbers gets interpreted as decimal delimiter. This happens if your number format setting in Windows is configured to use the comma sign as decimal separator.

The PowerToys Run calculator plugin supports the following operations:

| Operation |  Operator Syntax | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Addition |  a + b | |
| Subtraction | a - b | |
| Multiplication | a * b | |
| Division |  a / b | |
| Modulo/Remainder | a % b | |
| Exponentiation | a ^ b | |
| Ceiling | ceil( x.y ) |  Rounds a number up to the next larger integer. |
| Floor | floor( x.y ) | Rounds a number down to the next smaller integer. |
| Round | round( x.abcd ) | Rounds a fractional number to the nearest integer. |
| Exponential function | exp( x ) | Returns e raised to the specified power. |
| Maximum | max( x, y, z ) | |
| Minimum | min( x, y, z ) | |
| Absolute | abs( -x ) | Absolute value of a number |
| Log10 | log( x ) | |
| Log base e | ln( x ) | |
| Square root | sqrt( x ) | |
| Power | pow( x, y ) | Calculate a number (x) raised to the power of some other number (y) |
| Factorial | x! | |
| Sign | sign( -x ) | A number that indicates the sign of value:<br />- `-1` if number is less than zero.<br />- `0` if number is zero.<br />- `1` if number is greater than zero. |
| Random | rand() | Returns a fractional number between 0 and 1. |
| Pi | pi | Returns the number of Pi. |
| Sine | sin( x ) | |
| Cosine | cos( x ) | |
| Tangent | tan( x ) | |
| Arc Sine | arcsin( x ) | |
| Arc Cosine | arccos( x ) | |
| Arc Tangent | arctan( x ) | |
| Hyperbolic Sine | sinh( x ) | |
| Hyperbolic Cosine | cosh( x ) | |
| Hyperbolic Tangent | tanh( x ) | |
| Hyperbolic Arc Sine | arsinh( x ) | |
| Hyperbolic Arc Cosine | arcosh( x ) | |
| Hyperbolic Arc Tangent | artanh( x ) | |


### Time and Date values
The time and date plugin provides the current time and date or a custom one in different formats. You can enter the format or a custom time/date or both when searching.

> [!NOTE]
> The time and date plugin respects the date and time format settings of your system. Please be aware of the different notations in different locals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For global queries the first word of the query has to be a complete match.

Examples:
- `time` or `( time` to show the time.
- `( 3/27/2022` to show all available formats for a date value.
- `( calendar week::3/27/2022` to show the calendar week for a date value.
- `( unix epoch::3/27/2022 10:30:45 AM` to convert the given time and date value into a Unix epoch timestamp.


### Folder search filters

In the folder plugin you can filter the results by using some special characters.

| Character sequence | Result | Example
| :- | :- | :- |
| `>` | Search inside the folder. | `C:\Users\tom\Documents\>` |
| `*` | Search files by mask. | `C:\Users\tom\Documents\*.doc` |
| `>*` | Search files inside the folder by mask. | `C:\Users\tom\Documents\>*.doc` |

### Windows Settings plugin

The Windows Settings plugin allows you to search for Windows settings. You can search the settings by their name or by their location.

To search by location you can use the following syntax:
- `$ device:` to list all settings with 'device' in the area name.
- `$ control>system>admin` shows all settings of the path 'Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools'.

### Kill a window process

With the Window Walker plugin you can kill the process of a window if it hangs.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some limitations for the "kill process" feature:
> - Killing the Explorer process is only allowed if each folder window is running in its own process.
> - You can only kill elevated processes if you have admin permissions (UAC).
> - Windows of UWP apps don't know their process until they are searched in non-minimized state.

> [!WARNING]
> If you kill the process of an UWP app window, you kill all instances of the app. All windows are assigned to the same process.

#### File Explorer setting

If the File Explorer settings in Windows are not set to open each window in a seperate process, you will receive the following information when searching for open Explorer windows:

![Explorer Process Info IN PowerToys Run](../images/pt-run-explorer-info.png)

You can turn off the information in the PowerToys Run plugin manager options for Window Walker, or select the information to change the File Explorer settings. After selecting the information, the "Folder options" window will open.

On the "Folder options" window, you can enable the setting "Launch folder windows in a separate process".

### Windows Search settings

If the indexing settings for Windows Search are not set to cover all drives, you will receive the following warning when using the Windows Search plugin:

![PowerToys Run Indexer Warning](../images/pt-run-indexer-warning.png)

You can turn off the warning in the PowerToys Run plugin manager options for Windows Search, or select the warning to expand which drives are being indexed. After selecting the warning, the Windows settings page with the "Searching Windows" options will open.

![Indexing Settings](../images/pt-run-indexing.png)

On the "Searching Windows" page, you can:

- Select "Enhanced" mode to enable indexing across all of the drives on your Windows machine.
- Specify folder paths to exclude.
- Select the "Advanced Search Indexer Settings" (near the bottom of the menu options) to set advanced index settings, add or remove search locations, index encrypted files, etc.
