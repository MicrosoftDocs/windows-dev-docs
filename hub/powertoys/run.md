# PowerToys Run utility

PowerToys Run is a quick launcher for power users that contains some additional features without sacrificing performance. It is open source and modular for additional plugins.

To use PowerToys Run, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> and start typing!

*If that shortcut isn't what you like, don't worry, it is fully configurable in the settings.*

- Clickable buttons with keyboard shortcuts (such as *Open as administrator* or *Open containing folder*)

- Invoke Shell Plugin using `>`  (for example, `> Shell:startup` will open the Windows startup folder)

## Settings

The following Run options are available in the PowerToys settings menu.

  | **Settings** |**Action** |

  | Maximum number of results |  Maximum number of results shown without scrolling |
  | Clear the previous query on launch | When launched, previous searches will not be highlighted |
  | Disable drive detection warning | The warning, if all of your drives aren't indexed, will no longer be visible. |

  | --- | --- |
  | `=` | Calculator only. Example `=2+2`. |
  | `?` | File searching only. Example `?road` to find `roadmap.txt`. |
  | `.` | Installed programs only. Example `.code` to get Visual Studio Code. See [Program parameters](#program-parameters) for options on adding parameters to a program's startup. |
  | `//` | URLs only. Example `//docs.microsoft.com` to have your default browser go to https://docs.microsoft.com. |
  | `<` | Running processes only. Example `<outlook` to find all processes that contain outlook. |

## System commands

PowerToys Run enables a set of system level actions that can be executed.

  | **Action key**   |   **Action** |
  | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `Shutdown` | Shuts down the computer |
  | `Restart` | Restarts the computer |
  | `Sign Out` | Signs current user out |
  | `Lock` | Locks the computer |
  | `Sleep` | Sleeps the computer |
  | `Hibernate` | Hibernates the computer |
  | `Empty Recycle Bin` | Empties the recycle bin |

## Plugin manager

The PowerToys Run settings menu includes a plugin manager that allows you to enable/disable the various plugins currently available. By selecting and expanding the sections, you can customize the activation phrases used by each plugin. In addition, you can select whether a plugin appears in global results, as well as set additional plugin options where available. 

## Program parameters

The PowerToys Run program plugin allows for program arguments to be added when launching an application. The program arguments must follow the expected format as defined by the program's command line interface.

For example, when launching Visual Studio Code, you can specify the folder to be opened with:

`Visual Studio Code -- C:\myFolder`

Visual Studio Code also supports a set of [command line parameters](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line), which can be utilized with their corresponding arguments in PowerToys Run to, for instance, view the difference between files:

`Visual Studio Code -d C:\foo.txt C:\bar.txt` 

If the program plugin's option "Include in global result" is not selected, be sure to include the activation phrase, `.` by default, to invoke the plugin's behavior:

`.Visual Studio Code -- C:\myFolder`

## Monitor Positioning

If multiple monitors are in use, PowerToys Run can be launched on the desired monitor by configuring the appropriate launch behavior in the Settings menu. Options include opening on:

- Primary monitor
- Monitor with mouse cursor
- Monitor with focused window

## Windows Search settings

If the Windows Search plugin is not set to cover all drives, you will receive the following warning:

![PowerToys Run Indexer Warning](../images/pt-run-warning.png)

You can turn off the warning in the PowerToys Run plugin manager options for Windows Search, or select the warning to expand which drives are being indexed. After selecting the warning, the Windows 10 settings "Searching Windows" options menu will open.

![Indexing Settings](../images/pt-run-indexing.png)

In this "Searching Windows" menu, you can:

- Select "Enhanced" mode to enable indexing across all of the drives on your Windows 10 machine.
- Specify folder paths to exclude.
- Select the "Advanced Search Indexer Settings" (near the bottom of the menu options) to set advanced index settings, add or remove search locations, index encrypted files, etc.
