# Mouse utilities

Mouse utilities is a collection of features that enhance mouse and cursor functionality on Windows.

## Find My Mouse

Activate a spotlight that focuses on the cursor's position pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key twice, using a custom shortcut or shaking the mouse. Click the mouse or press any keyboard key to dismiss it. If you move the mouse while the spotlight is active, the spotlight will dismiss on its own shortly after the mouse stops moving.
