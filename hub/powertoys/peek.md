# Peek utility

A system-wide utility for Windows that allows you to preview file content without the need to open multiple applications or interrupt your workflow. It offers a seamless and quick file preview experience for various file types, including images, web pages, Markdown files, text files, and developer files.

## Preview file

Select a file in the File Explorer and open the Peek preview using the activation / deactivation shortcut (default: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>). 
Using <kbd>left</kbd> and <kbd>right</kbd>, you can switch between all files in the current folder. 
Select multiple files in the File Explorer for previewing to switch only between selected ones.

## Pin preview window position and size

The Peek window adjusts its size based on the dimensions of the images being previewed. However, if you prefer to keep the window's size and position, you can utilize the pinning feature. 
By clicking the pinning button located in the top right corner of the Peek window, the window will preserve the current size and position. 
Clicking the pinning button again will unpin the window. When unpinned, the Peek window will return to the default position and size when previewing the next file.

## Open with the default program

Click the **Open with** button on the top or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the current previewed file with the default program.

## Settings

From the Settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activation shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to open Peek for the selected file(s). |
