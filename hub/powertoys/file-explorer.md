# File Explorer add-ons utility

File Explorer add-ons currently include:

- Preview Pane rendering of SVG icons (.svg)
- Preview Pane rendering of Markdown files (.md)

## Preview Pane

Preview Pane is an existing feature in the Windows File Explorer which shows a lightweight, rich, read-only preview of the file's contents in the view's reading pane. PowerToys adds two extensions, Markdown and SVG.

## Enabling Preview Pane

To enable, first ensure that "Enable SVG preview", "Enable SVG thumbnails", and "Enable Markdown preview" are all set to On in the PowerToys Settings.
