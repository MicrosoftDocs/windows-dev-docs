### Install Mouse Without Borders as a service

To allow Mouse Without Borders to control elevated applications or the lock screen from another computer, it's possible to run Mouse Without Borders as a service under the System account.

To enable the service mode, run PowerToys in administrator mode and turn on the **Use Service** toggle.

> [!WARNING]
> Running Mouse Without Borders as a service account brings added control and ease of use to the controlled machines, but this also brings some additional security risks in case someone wants to use Mouse Without Borders as an attack vector. Be mindful of your risk tolerance.

If the connection is lost:

- Make sure the machines are still connected.
- Select **Refresh connections** in Settings (or use the Refresh shortcut).

## Known Issues

- Copy/Paste between machines only works with a single file and the size limit is 100MB.
- Drag/Drop between machines works with single file only and it does not work with network files.
- Copy/Paste, Drag/Drop does not work with folder and multiple files, the workaround is to zip them first.
- If the host machine has a full-screen focused Remote Desktop/virtual machine window (or some kind of simulator window), the keyboard might not follow the mouse to another machine. The workaround is to enable the option "Hide mouse at screen edge" in the Settings or switch the focus to another window first.
- The mouse pointer might be invisible if there is no physical mouse attached to the machine. Plug in an unused mouse or turn on **Mouse Keys** in Control Panel.
- Some settings may not sync correctly and may need to be manually changed to be the same on all machines.
