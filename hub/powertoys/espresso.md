# Espresso utility

Espresso is a Windows tool designed to keep a computer awake on-demand without having to manage its power settings. This behavior can be helpful when running time-consuming tasks while ensuring that the computer does not go to sleep or turn off its screens.

## Getting started

Espresso can be used directly from PowerToys settings or as a standalone executable. When the utility is running from PowerToys, it can also be managed from the system tray.

>[!NOTE]
>Espresso does not modify any of the Windows power plan settings, and does not depend on power plan configuration. Instead, it spawns background threads that tell Windows that they require a specific state of the machine.

### PowerToys settings

In the PowerToys settings view, you can start Espresso by using the **Enable Espresso** toggle. Once enabled, the application will manage the state of the computer.

The default setting is **Keep awake indefinitely** which ensures that the computer does not go to sleep while Espresso is enabled, without any time limit.

It's also possible to use Espresso to keep the computer awake for a pre-defined time period. To do that, use the **Keep awake temporarily** switch in PowerToys settings and specify the number of hours and minutes during which the computer will stay awake. Once the time is set, the countdown begins automatically - you do not need to do anything else.

>Changing the hours or minutes while the computer is kept awake temporarily will reset the timer.

While Espresso can keep the computer awake indefinitely or temporarily, in its default state the displays connected to the machine will turn off, even though the computer won't go to sleep. If you need the displays to be available, use the **Keep screen on** switch, which will ensure that all monitors remain on.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Espresso can also be executed as a standalone application, directly from the PowerToys folder. The following command line arguments can be used when running the utility from the terminal:

This settings assumes that there is a `settings.json` file for Espresso, generated by PowerToys, that contains all required runtime information, such as the mode it should work in (indefinite or timed), whether screens should be kept on, and what the values for hours and minutes are for a temporary keep-awake.
