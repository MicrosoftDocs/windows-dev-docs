# Install PowerToys

We recommend installing PowerToys via GitHub or Microsoft Store, but alternative install methods are also listed if you prefer using a package manager.

## Install with Windows executable file via GitHub

> [Install PowerToys](https://aka.ms/installpowertoys)

To install PowerToys using a Windows executable file:

1. Visit the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page](https://aka.ms/installpowertoys).
2. Select the **Assets** drop-down menu to display the files for the release.
3. Select the `PowerToysSetup-0.##.#-x64.exe` file to download the PowerToys executable installer.
4. Once downloaded, open the executable file and follow the installation prompts.

## Requirements

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 v1903 (18362) or newer.
- [.NET Core 3.1.20 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.20-windows-x64-installer) or a newer 3.1.x runtime. The installer will handle this if not present.
- x64 architecture currently supported. ARM support to become available at a later date.

To ensure that your machine meets these requirements, check your Windows version and build number by selecting <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, then type `winver` and press <kbd>OK</kbd>. Or enter the `ver` command in Windows Command Prompt. You can [update to the latest Windows version](ms-settings:windowsupdate) in the **Windows Settings**.

## Post Install

After successfully installing PowerToys, an overview window will display with introductory guidance on each of the available utilities.

## Updates

PowerToys uses an auto-updater that checks for new versions when the app is running. If enabled, a toast notification will appear when an update is available. Updates can also be checked for manually from the PowerToys Settings, under the General page.
