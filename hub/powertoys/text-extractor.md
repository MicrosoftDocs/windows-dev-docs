# Text Extractor utility

Text Extractor is a convenient way to copy text from anywhere on your screen. This code is based on [Joe Finney's Text Grab](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Text-Grab).

## How to activate

With the activation shortcut (default: <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), you'll see an overlay on the screen. Click and hold your primary mouse button and drag to activate your capture. The text will be saved to your clipboard.

## Adjust while trying to capture

By holding <kbd>shift</kbd>, you will change from adjusting the capture region's size to moving the capture region. When you release <kbd>shift</kbd>, you will be able to resize again.

## Things to note

1. This uses OCR (Optical character recognition) to read the text on the screen.  
2. It may not be perfect so you will have to do a quick proof read of the output.
3. The default language used will be based on your [Windows system language / keyboard settings](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-the-input-and-display-language-settings-in-windows-12a10cb4-8626-9b77-0ccb-5013e0c7c7a2) (OCR language packs are available for install).

## Settings

From the Settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activation shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to turn on or off always on top for that window. |
