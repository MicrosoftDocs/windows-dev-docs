# Windows Subsystem for Android™️ Preview Program

> [!IMPORTANT]

The Windows Subsystem for Android™️ Preview Program allows users to receive early-preview builds of the Windows Subsystem for Android™ and Amazon Appstore on Windows. Installing the Amazon Appstore on Windows automatically installs Windows Subsystem for Android™️. Learn more about [installing the Amazon Appstore](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/install-mobile-apps-and-the-amazon-appstore-f8d0abb5-44ad-47d8-b9fb-ad6b1459ff6c).

> [!NOTE]
> This program is separate from the Windows Insider Program and *only* enrolls your account into receiving preview builds of Windows Subsystem for Android™️. 

Preview builds may not always be stable and users may encounter issues that block apps or require workarounds.
