Listing your app in the right primary category, subcategory and an optional secondary category helps customers find your app and understand more about it. Secondary category has the same list of categories as the Primary category.

You must choose the category that best describes your app. You can optionally choose a subcategory, if available. If you're not sure which category or subcategory to use, or you can't find one that seems to be an exact fit, choose the one that you think customers are most likely to look at when trying to find apps like yours.

To change the category, subcategory or secondary category of an app that's already in the Store, [update your app](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/publish-update-to-your-app-on-store.md) and select the new category, subcategory or secondary category.
