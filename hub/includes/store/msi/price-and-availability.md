## Markets

The Microsoft Store reaches customers in over 240 countries and regions around the world. By default, we’ll offer your app in all possible markets. If you prefer, you can choose the specific markets in which you'd like to offer your app.

For more info, see [Define market selection](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/market-selection.md).

## Visibility

The **Visibility** section allows you to set restrictions on how your app can be discovered and acquired, including whether people can find your app in the Store or see its Store listing at all.

For more info, see [Choose visibility options](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/visibility-options.md).

## Schedule

By default (unless you have selected one of the **Make this app available but not discoverable in the Store** options in the Visibility section), your app will be available to customers as soon as it passes certification and complete the publishing process. To choose other dates, select **Show options** to expand this section.

For more info, see [Configure precise release scheduling](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/release-schedule.md).

## Discoverability

The selections in the Discoverability section indicate how customers can discover and acquire your app.

### Make this product available and discoverable in the Store

This is the default option. Leave this option selected if you want your app to be listed in the Store for customers to find via the app's direct link and/or by other methods, including searching, browsing, and inclusion in curated lists.

### Make this product available but not discoverable in the Store

When you select this option, your app can’t be found in the Store by customers searching or browsing; the only way to get to your app’s listing is by a direct link.
