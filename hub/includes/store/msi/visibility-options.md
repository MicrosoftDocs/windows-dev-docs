## Discoverability

The **Discoverability** section of the [Pricing and availability page](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/price-and-availability.md) allows you to set restrictions on how your app can be discovered and acquired.

- **Make this product available and discoverable in the Store** - This is the default option. Leave this option selected if you want your app to be listed in the Store for customers to find via the app's direct link and/or by other methods, including searching, browsing, and inclusion in curated lists.
- **Make this product available through direct link only but not discoverable in the Microsoft Store** - When you select this option, your app can’t be found in the Store by customers searching or browsing; the only way to get to your app’s listing is by a direct link.
