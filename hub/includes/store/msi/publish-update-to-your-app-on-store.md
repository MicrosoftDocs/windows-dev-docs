We recommend you submit updates for your EXE or MSI apps through the Store. This ensures that new customers always get and install your latest app version.

The Store allows existing users to install in-app updates through your app, if your installer supports it. The Store does not provide these updates automatically or manually to existing users. 

You can make changes to a published app at any time. To submit updates, go to the application's overview page in Partner Center. Navigate to the Update app section. An update submission has already been created using the info from your previous submission as a starting point.

To add new functionalities that require written customer consent via your app update, you must provide notice to customers and get their written consent as required by law in the markets where you choose to distribute your app.
