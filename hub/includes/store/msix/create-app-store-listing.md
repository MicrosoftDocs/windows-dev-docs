The **Store listings** section of the [app submission process](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/create-app-submission.md) is where you provide the text and [images](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/screenshots-and-images.md) that customers will see when viewing your app's listing in the Microsoft Store.

Many of the fields in a **Store listing** are optional, but we suggest providing multiple images and as much info as possible to make your listing stand out. The minimum required for the **Store listings** step to be considered complete is a text description and at least one [screenshot](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/screenshots-and-images.md#screenshots).

> [!TIP]
> You can optionally [import and export Store listings](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/import-and-export-store-listings.md) if you'd prefer to enter your listing info offline in a .csv file, rather than providing info and uploading files directly in Partner Center. Using the import and export option can be especially convenient if you have listings in many languages, since it lets you make multiple updates at once.

## Store listing languages

You must complete the **Store listing** page for at least one language. We recommend providing a Store listing in each language that your packages support, but you have flexibility to remove languages for which you don’t wish to provide a Store listing. You can also create Store listings in additional languages which aren’t supported by your packages.

> [!NOTE]
> If your submission includes packages already, we’ll show the [languages](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/supported-languages.md) supported in your packages on the app overview page (unless you remove any of them).

To add or remove languages for your Store listings, click **Add/remove languages** from the app overview page. If you‘ve already uploaded packages, you’ll see their languages listed in the **Languages supported by your packages** section. To remove one or more of these languages, click **Remove**. If you later decide to include a language that you previously removed from this section, you can click **Add**.

In the **Additional Store listing languages** section, you can click **Manage additional languages** to add or remove languages that are *not* included in your packages. Check the boxes for the languages that you’d like to add, then click **Update**. The languages you’ve selected will be displayed in the **Additional Store listing languages** section. To remove one or more of these languages, click **Remove** (or click **Manage additional languages** and uncheck the box for languages you’d like to remove).
