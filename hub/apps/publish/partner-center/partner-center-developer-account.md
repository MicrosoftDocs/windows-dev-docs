# Developer accounts in Partner Center

To publish your app in the Microsoft Store, you'll need to register as a Windows app developer in [Partner Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-store/register/). You can register with an existing Microsoft Account or by creating a new Microsoft account.

> [!NOTE]
> When you sign up for a developer account, we'll use the email address you provide in your contact info to send messages related to your account. At times, these may include information about our programs. If you choose to [opt out](https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account?ru=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fprofile%2Fcontact-info&destrt=profile-landing) of these informational emails, be aware that we'll still send you transactional messages (for example, to let you know that a payment is on the way). These transactional emails are a necessary part of your account, and unless you close your account, you'll continue to receive them.

## Additional guidelines for company accounts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To allow multiple users to access your developer account, we recommend using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to assign roles to individual users instead of sharing access to the Microsoft account. Each user can then access the developer account by signing in to Partner Center with their individual Azure AD credentials. For more info, see [Manage account users](manage-account-users.md).

If you want to let multiple people access the company account by signing in with the Microsoft account that opened it (instead of as individual users added to the account), see the following guidelines:

- Email ownership verifies that the primary contact (primary email) address is valid. The primary contact email address must be a work account that is monitored and can send/receive email. Partners should **not** use: (1) a personal email address not associated with the company domain, or (2) a tenant user sign-in not associated to email (for example, jsmith@testcompany.onmicrosoft.com).
- Limit access to this Microsoft account to the least number of users possible.
- Set up a corporate email distribution list that includes everyone who needs to access the developer account. Add this email address to the [security info associated with the Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/security). This approach allows all the employees on the list to receive security codes that are sent to this alias. If setting up a distribution list isn't feasible, you can add an individual's email address to your security info. But, the owner of that email address will be the only person who can access and share the security code when prompted (such as when new security info is added to the account or when the account is accessed from a new device).
- Add a company phone number to the Microsoft account's security info. Try to use a number that doesn't require an extension and that's accessible to key team members.
- Encourage developers to use [trusted devices](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12369/microsoft-account-add-a-trusted-device) to sign in to your company's developer account. All key team members should have access to these trusted devices. This arrangement reduces the need for security codes to be sent when team members access the account. There's a limit to the number of codes that can be generated per account per week.
- If you need to allow access to the account from a non-trusted PC, limit that access to a maximum of five developers. Ideally, these developers should access the account from machines that share the same geographical and network location.
- Frequently review your company’s security info at https://account.microsoft.com/security to make sure it's all current.

## Microsoft account security

We use security info that you provide to raise the security level of your Microsoft account by associating it with multiple forms of identification. This makes unauthorized access to your Microsoft account (and your developer account) substantially more difficult. Also, if you ever forget your password or if someone else tries to access your account, we’ll be able to reach you to confirm ownership and/or re-establish appropriate control of your account.

You must have at least two email addresses or phone numbers on your Microsoft account. We recommend adding as many as possible. Remember that some security info must be confirmed before it will be valid. Also, make sure to review your security info frequently and verify that it's up to date. You can manage your security info by going to https://account.microsoft.com/security and signing in with your Microsoft account. For more info, see [Account security info & verification codes](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-verification-codes).

When you sign in to Partner Center through your Microsoft account, the system may prompt you to verify your identity by sending a security code, which you must enter to complete the sign-in process. We recommend designating PCs that you use frequently as *trusted devices*. When you sign in from a trusted device, you typically aren't prompted for a code, although you may occasionally be prompted in specific situations or if you haven’t signed in on that device in a long time. For more info, see [Add a trusted device to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12369/microsoft-account-add-a-trusted-device).
