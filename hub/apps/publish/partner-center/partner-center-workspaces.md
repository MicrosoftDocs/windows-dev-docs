# Partner Center Workspaces

Partner Center is the central place for partners to manage their relationship with Microsoft. As part of our commitment to make it easier to do business with Microsoft, we’re updating the user experience. These changes bring consistency across Partner Center and related Microsoft portals and will help partners have a more efficient and productive experience as they complete tasks. As part of the changes, we’ll define clear user roles, institute consistent and inclusive design principles, and organize where users complete their tasks into **workspaces**. We’ll launch with the initial experience and continue to release improvements throughout the year.

## What does the transition to the new Partner Center user experience mean for me?

We’ve reorganized where you can complete tasks into workspaces, with no loss of capabilities. You can continue doing business in the new Partner Center user experience, in the respective workspaces below.

| Workspace            | Tasks |
|----------------------|-------|
| **Account settings** | View and edit your account settings, including your company profile, bank information, users, and permissions |
| **Insights**         | View data on your customers and their purchases, and gain insights on how to grow your business. |
| **Apps and games**   | Create, publish, and manage products for the Windows and Xbox Store. |
| **Payouts**          | Set up your payout account, and view and manage payout statements. |
| **Support**          | Get service health updates, view support articles, contact support, schedule support appointments, and manage your support requests. |

### Will these changes impact APIs?

No, these user experience changes will not impact APIs.

### Will there be any loss of workflows/capabilities?

No, there will be workflow parity between the old and new user experience.
