Thank you for your interest in developing products for the Microsoft Store<sup>1</sup>. "Product" means content in whatever form submitted including, but not limited to, apps, games, titles, and any additional content sold or offered from within a Product. We’re committed to a diverse catalog of products for customers worldwide. Products on the Store must meet our certification standards, offer customers a truly useful and engaging experience, and provide a good fit for the Store.

A few principles to get you started:

- Offer unique and distinct value within your product. Provide a compelling reason to download your product from the Store.
- Don’t mislead our joint customers about what your product can do, who is offering it, etc.
- Don’t attempt to cheat customers, the system or the ecosystem. There is no place in our Store for any kind of fraud, be it ratings and review manipulation, credit card fraud or other fraudulent activity.

Adhering to these policies should help you make choices that enhance your product’s appeal and audience.

Your products are crucial to the experience of hundreds of millions of customers. We can’t wait to see what you create and are thrilled to help deliver your products to the world.

If you have feedback on the policies, please let us know by commenting in [our forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/home?forum=windowsstore). We will consider every comment.

### 10.5 Personal Information

The following requirements apply to products that access Personal Information. Personal Information includes all information or data that identifies or could be used to identify a person, or that is associated with such information or data.

**10.5.1**

If your product accesses, collects or transmits Personal Information, or if otherwise required by law, you must maintain a privacy policy. You must provide users with access to your privacy policy by entering the privacy policy URL in Partner Center when you submit your product. In addition, you may also include or link to your privacy policy in the product. The privacy policy can be hosted within or directly linked from the product. Your privacy policy must inform users of the Personal Information accessed, collected or transmitted by your product, how that information is used, stored and secured, and indicate the types of parties to whom it is disclosed. It must describe the controls that users have over the use and sharing of their information and how they may access their information, and it must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Your privacy policy must be kept up-to-date as you add new features and functionality to your product.

Product types that inherently have access to Personal Information must always have privacy policies. These include, but are not limited to, Edge Extension and Desktop Bridge products.

**10.5.2**

You may publish the Personal Information of customers of your product to an outside service or third party through your product or its metadata only after obtaining opt-in consent from those customers. Opt-in consent means the customer gives their express permission in the product user interface for the requested activity, after you have:

- described to the customer how the information will be accessed, used or shared, indicating the types of parties to whom it is disclosed, and
- provided the customer a mechanism in the product user interface through which they can later rescind this permission and opt-out.

**10.5.3**

If you publish a person’s Personal Information to an outside service or third party through your product or its metadata, but the person whose information is being shared is not a customer of your product, you must obtain express written consent to publish that Personal Information, and you must permit the person whose information is shared to withdraw that consent at any time. If your product provides a customer with access to another person’s Personal Information, this requirement would also apply.

**10.5.4**

If your product collects, stores or transmits Personal Information, it must do so securely, by using modern cryptography methods.

**10.5.5**

Your product must not collect, store or transmit highly sensitive personal information, such as health or financial data, unless the information is related to the product’s functionality.

**10.5.6**

If your product supports Microsoft identity authentication it must do so only by using Microsoft-approved methods.

**10.5.7**

Products that receive device location must provide settings that allow the user to enable and disable the product's access to and use of location from the Location Service API. For Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 products, these settings must be provided in-product. For Windows Mobile 10 products, these settings are provided automatically by Windows within the Settings App (on the **Settings > Privacy > Location** page). You must respect such settings, and if you choose to collect device location data in another way, such data is Personal Information and collection is subject to the other requirements of section 10.5. You must gain legally sufficient consent for your data practices, and such practices must generally comply with applicable laws and regulations.


### 10.6 Capabilities

The capabilities you declare must legitimately relate to the functions of your product, and the use of those declarations must comply with our product capability declarations. You must not circumvent operating system checks for capability usage.


### 10.7 Localization

You must localize your product for all languages that it supports. The text of your product’s description must be localized in each language that you declare. If your product is localized such that some features are not available in a localized version, you must clearly state or display the limits of localization in the product description. The experience provided by a product must be reasonably similar in all languages that it supports.


### 10.8 Financial Transactions

If your product includes in-product purchase, subscriptions, virtual currency, billing functionality or captures financial information, the following requirements apply:

**10.8.1**

You must use the Microsoft Store in-product purchase API to sell digital items or services that are consumed or used within your product. Your product may enable users to consume previously purchased digital content or services, but must not direct users to a purchase mechanism other than the Microsoft Store in-product purchase API.

In-product offerings sold in your product cannot be converted to any legally valid currency (for example, USD, Euro, etc.) or any physical goods or services.

**10.8.2**

You must use the Microsoft payment request API or a secure third party purchase API for purchases of physical goods or services, and a secure third party purchase API for payments made in connection with real world gambling or charitable contributions. If your product is used to facilitate or collect charitable contributions or to conduct a promotional sweepstakes or contest, you must do so in compliance with applicable law. You must also state clearly that Microsoft is not the fundraiser or sponsor of the promotion.

You must use the Microsoft payment request API or a secure third party purchase API to receive voluntary donations from users. If the user receives digital goods or services in return, including but not limited to additional features or removal of advertising, you must use the Microsoft Store in-product purchase API instead.

The following requirements apply to your use of a secure third party purchase API:
- At the time of the transaction or when you collect any payment or financial information from the customer, your product must identify the commerce transaction provider, authenticate the user, and obtain user confirmation for the transaction.
- The product can offer the user the ability to save this authentication, but the user must have the ability to either require an authentication on every transaction or to turn off in-product transactions.
- If your product collects credit card information or uses a third-party payment processor that collects credit card information, the payment processing must meet the current PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

**10.8.3**

If your product requires financial account information, you must submit that product from a company account type.

**10.8.4**

Your product and its associated metadata must provide information about the types of in-product purchases offered and the range of prices. You may not mislead customers and must be clear about the nature of your in-product promotions and offerings including the scope and terms of any trial experiences. If your product restricts access to user-created content during or after a trial, you must notify users in advance. In addition, your product must make it clear to users that they are initiating a purchase option in the product.

If your game offers “loot boxes” or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items, then you must disclose the odds of receiving each item to customers prior to purchase. These disclosures may appear: in-product, such as in an in-app store, on the Microsoft Store Product Description Page (PDP), and/or on a developer or publisher website, with a link from the Store Product Description Page (PDP) and/or in-app.

**10.8.6**

You must use the Microsoft recurring billing API to bill for subscriptions of digital goods or services, and the following guidelines apply:
- You may add value to a subscription but may not remove value for users who have previously purchased it.
- If you discontinue an active subscription, you must continue to provide purchased digital goods or services until the subscription expires.

**10.8.7**

All pricing, including sales or discounting, for your digital products or services shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidelines, including without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission [Guides Against Deceptive Pricing](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=676bd39fe43a808fcb417973b3d0247e&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title16/16cfr233_main_02.tpl). 

### 10.9 Notifications

Your product must respect system settings for notifications and remain functional when they are disabled. This includes the presentation of ads and notifications to the customer, which must also be consistent with the customer’s preferences, whether the notifications are provided by the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS), Windows Push Notification Service (WNS) or any other service. If the customer disables notifications, either on a product-specific or system-wide basis, your product must remain functional.

If your product uses MPNS or WNS to transmit notifications, it must comply with the following requirements:

**10.9.1**

Because notifications provided through WNS or MPNS are considered product content, they are subject to all Store Policies.

**10.9.2**

You may not obscure or try to disguise the source of any notification initiated by your product.

**10.9.3**

You may not include in a notification any information a customer would reasonably consider to be confidential or sensitive.
