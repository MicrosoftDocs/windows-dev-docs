# Init Command

Helps you setup your application to publish to the Microsoft Store.

## Description

The `init` command helps you setup your application to publish to the Microsoft Store. It currently supports the following application types:
- Windows App SDK/WinUI 3
- UWP
- .NET MAUI
- Flutter
- Electron
- React Native for Windows
- PWA

## Usage Examples

### Windows App SDK/WinUI 3

```console
msstore init "C:\path\to\winui3_app"
```

### UWP

```console
msstore init "C:\path\to\uwp_app"
```

### .NET MAUI

```console
msstore init "C:\path\to\maui_app"
```

### Flutter

```console
msstore init "C:\path\to\flutter_app"
```

### Electron

```console
msstore init "C:\path\to\electron_app"
```

### React Native for Windows

```console
msstore init "C:\path\to\react_native_app"
```

> [!Note]
> For Electron, as well as React Native for Windows projects, both `Npm` and `Yarn` are supported. The presence of the `Yarn` lock file (`yarn.lock`) will be used to determine which package manager to use, so make sure that you check in your lock file into your source control system.

### PWA

```console
msstore init https://contoso.com --output .
```
