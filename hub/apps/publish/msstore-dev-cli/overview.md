# Microsoft Store Developer CLI (preview)

The Microsoft Store Command Line Interface is a cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) CLI that helps developers publish their applications to the Microsoft Store. It allows developers to locally configure their applications projects to publish to the Microsoft Store, as well as actually publish their applications' packages to the Microsoft Store, automatically calling the right [Partner Center APIs](/partner-center/develop/partner-center-rest-api-reference) to upload its packages.

## Prerequisites

To use the Microsoft Store Developer CLI, you'll need to:
- [Register as a Windows app developer in Partner Center](/windows/apps/publish/partner-center/partner-center-developer-account)
- Have a tenant associated with your Partner Center account. You can achieve that by either [associating an existing Azure AD in Partner Center](/windows/apps/publish/partner-center/associate-existing-azure-ad-tenant-with-partner-center-account) or by [creating a new Azure AD in Partner Center](/windows/apps/publish/partner-center/create-new-azure-ad-tenant).

```console
msstore
```

> [!Important]
> When signing in, don't use your MSA! The **Microsoft Store Developer CLI** requires you to use your **Azure AD credentials**. You can find more information about this in our [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

Running in CI environments is also supported, and the Microsoft Store Developer CLI (preview) can be used in your CI/CD pipelines to, for example, automatically publish your applications to the Microsoft Store. More instructions on how to do this can be found [here](ci-cd-environments.md).
