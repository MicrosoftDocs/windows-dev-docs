# What's new - MSIX app overview page

The MSIX application overview page has received some updates to simplify the navigation and enhance the user experience. The following are some of the key changes:

## 1.	Submission sections can be directly accessed from the application overview page

Previously, the developer had to go to the submission overview page to see the status of each of the submission sections of their product.

Now, the submission sections and their respective status are directly accessible and visible from the application overview page. The old submission overview page is no longer available. The “Submit for certification” button has now been kept at the Product release section which comprises of Product submission.

## 2.	Delete submission and Delete product options are now clubbed together

In previous experience, to delete a product, a developer had to delete a submission first and then delete the product.

In the new experience, a developer cannot delete just the draft submission. If a developer clicks on ‘Delete product’, the existing submission and the product will be deleted. The ‘Delete product’ option can be found adjacent to the product name on the top of the page.

> [!NOTE] 
> The ‘Delete product’ option will be applicable only for the first draft submission. After the product is live, developer cannot delete the product. 

## 3.	App status is now shown on the application overview page

The application status (eg: In draft, In certification, In Microsoft Store, Update in draft etc.) is now shown on the top of the application overview page.
