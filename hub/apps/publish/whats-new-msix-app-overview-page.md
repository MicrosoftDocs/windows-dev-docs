# What's new - MSIX app overview page

The MSIX application overview page has received some updates to simplify the navigation and enhance the user experience. The following are some of the key changes:

## 1.	Submission sections can be directly accessed from the application overview page

Previously, the developer had to go to the submission overview page to see the status of each of the submission sections of their product.
