# Microsoft Store Policies

**Document version: 7.18**

**Publish date: September 10, 2024**

**Effective date: October 10, 2024**

> [!NOTE]
> Some older versions of this agreement, along with summary of recent changes are available at [Change history for Microsoft Store Policies](store-policies-change-history.md).


Thank you for your interest in developing products for the Microsoft Store<sup>1</sup>. "Product" means content in whatever form submitted including, but not limited to, apps, games, titles, add-ons, in-product consumables, subscriptions and any additional content soldor offered in any of our storefronts or within a Product. We’re committed to a diverse catalog of products for customers worldwide. Products on the Store must meet our certification standards, offer customers a truly useful and engaging experience, and provide a good fit for the Store.

A few principles to get you started:

- Offer unique and distinct value within your product. Provide a compelling reason to download your product from the Store.
- Don’t mislead our joint customers about what your product can do, who is offering it, etc.
- Don’t attempt to cheat customers, the system or the ecosystem. There is no place in our Store for any kind of fraud, be it ratings and review manipulation, credit card fraud or other fraudulent activity.

Adhering to these policies should help you make choices that enhance your product’s appeal and audience.

Your products are crucial to the experience of hundreds of millions of customers. We can’t wait to see what you create and are thrilled to help deliver your products to the world.

If you have feedback on the policies, please let us know by commenting in [our forum](/answers/topics/partner-center-general.html). We will consider every comment.

- While content offered via your product is not subject to certification, your content must adhere to all applicable Store Policies.
- If your product uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use.

You must provide users with access to your privacy policy by entering the privacy policy URL in Partner Center when you submit your product. In addition, you may also include or link to your privacy policy in the product. The privacy policy can be hosted within or directly linked from the product. Your privacy policy must inform users of the Personal Information accessed, collected or transmitted by your product, how that information is used, stored and secured, and indicate the types of parties to whom it is disclosed. It must describe the controls that users have over the use and sharing of their information and how they may access their information, and it must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Your privacy policy must be kept up-to-date as you add new features and functionality to your product.

Product types that inherently have access to Personal Information must always have privacy policies. These include, but are not limited to, Desktop Bridge and Win32 products. 

**10.5.2**

You may publish the Personal Information of customers of your product to an outside service or third party through your product or its metadata only after obtaining opt-in consent from those customers. Opt-in consent means the customer gives their express permission in the product user interface for the requested activity, after you have:

- described to the customer how the information will be accessed, used or shared, indicating the types of parties to whom it is disclosed, and
- provided the customer a mechanism in the product user interface through which they can later rescind this permission and opt-out.

**10.5.3**

If you publish a person’s Personal Information to an outside service or third party through your product or its metadata, but the person whose information is being shared is not a customer of your product, you must obtain express written consent to publish that Personal Information, and you must permit the person whose information is shared to withdraw that consent at any time. If your product provides a customer with access to another person’s Personal Information, this requirement would also apply.

**10.5.4**

If your product collects, stores or transmits Personal Information, it must do so securely, by using modern cryptography methods.

**10.5.5**

Your product must not collect, store or transmit highly sensitive personal information, such as health or financial data, unless the information is related to the product’s functionality. Your product must also obtain express user consent before collecting, storing or transmitting such information. Your product’s privacy policy must clearly tell the user when and why you are collecting Personal Information and how you will use it.

**10.5.7**

Products that receive device location must provide settings that allow the user to enable and disable the product's access to and use of location from the Location Service API. You must respect such settings, and if you choose to collect device location data in another way, such data is Personal Information and collection is subject to the other requirements of section 10.5. You must gain legally sufficient consent for your data practices, and such practices must generally comply with applicable laws and regulations.

**10.5.8**

Your product must follow all applicable safety and privacy laws around the world relating to collection of personal information from children.

You must localize your product for all languages that it supports. The text of your product’s description must be localized in each language that you declare. If your product is localized such that some features are not available in a localized version, you must clearly state or display the limits of localization in the product description. The experience provided by a product must be reasonably similar in all languages that it supports.

### 10.8 Financial Transactions

If your product includes in-product purchase, subscriptions, virtual currency, billing functionality or captures financial information, the following requirements apply:

**10.8.1**

The following products are required to use the Microsoft Store in-product purchase APIs for the purchase of digital goods and services. Purchase of digital goods and services includes voluntary donations that result in the user receiving digital goods or services in return for the donation, including but not limited to additional features or removal of advertising.

- (a) Games (excluding games made available through a subscription in PC gaming subscription products and in-app purchases in such games)

- (b) Products offered on Xbox consoles.  

If your product is required to use the **Microsoft in-product purchase API** it must not direct users to a purchase mechanism other than the Microsoft Store in-product purchase API but may enable users to consume previously purchased digital content or services.

Non-game products made available on PC devices may either use a secure third-party purchase API or the Microsoft Store in-product purchase API for in-app purchases of digital items or services that are consumed or used within the product.

Digital in-product offerings sold in your product using the Microsoft in-product purchase API cannot be converted to, or exchanged for, any legally valid currency (for example, USD, Euro, etc.) or any physical goods or services or other currency of real-world value.


**10.8.2**

You must use the Microsoft payment request API or a secure third-party purchase API for purchases of physical goods or services, and a secure third-party purchase API for payments made in connection with real-world gambling or charitable contributions. If your product is used to facilitate or collect charitable contributions or to conduct a promotional sweepstakes or contest, you must do so in compliance with applicable law. You must also state clearly that Microsoft is not the fundraiser or sponsor of the promotion.

You must use the Microsoft payment request API or a secure third-party purchase API to receive voluntary donations from users. However, if the user receives digital goods or services in return, including but not limited to additional features or removal of advertising, you must use the Microsoft Store in-product purchase API instead.

In cases where your product’s use of a secure third-party purchase API is allowed or required, the following requirements apply:

* At the time of the transaction or when you collect any payment or financial information from the customer, your product must identify the commerce transaction provider, authenticate the user, and obtain the user’s confirmation of the transaction.

* Your product can offer the user the ability to permanently remain authenticated, but the user must have the ability to either require an authentication on every transaction or to turn off in-product transactions.

* If your product collects credit card information or uses a third-party payment processor that collects credit card information, the payment processing must meet the current PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

* If your product requires user registration or payment transaction experience at install, it must take place in the product’s in-app experience. After installation of your product is completed, users may be directed to a browser to complete registration or transactions.

* Digital in-game product offerings cannot be converted to, or exchanged for, any legally valid currency (for example, USD, Euro, etc.) or other currency of real-world value.


**10.8.3**

If your product requires financial account information, you must submit that product from a company account type.

Products from individual accounts cannot require financial information for primary functionality.

Financial information includes, but is not limited to, entering bank or credit card account information, account pins or passwords, tax ID information, initiating cryptocurrency transactions, access to cryptocurrency exchanges, API secret keys, private keys, or recovery phrases. 



**10.8.4**

Your product and its associated metadata must provide information about the types of in-product purchases offered and the range of prices. You may not mislead customers and must be clear about the nature of your in-product promotions and offerings including the scope and terms of any trial experiences. If your product restricts access to user-created content during or after a trial, you must notify users in advance. In addition, your product must make it clear to users that they are initiating a purchase option in the product.

If your game offers “loot boxes” or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items, then you must disclose the odds of receiving each item to customers prior to purchase. These disclosures may appear: in-product, such as in an in-app store, on the Microsoft Store Product Description Page (PDP), and/or on a developer or publisher website, with a link from the Store Product Description Page (PDP) and/or in-app.


**10.8.6**

Non-game products made available on PC devices may either use a secure third-party or the Microsoft recurring billing API to bill for subscriptions of digital goods or services, and the following guidelines apply:

- You may add value to a subscription but may not remove value for users who have previously purchased it.
- If you discontinue an active subscription, you must continue to provide purchased digital goods or services until the subscription expires.
- PC gaming subscription products (products whose primary functionality is to enable access to a catalog of games via a subscription service) may either use the Microsoft Store in-product purchase API or a secure third-party purchase API for in-game purchases within games made available through the subscription service, subject to the secure third-party purchase API requirements.
  - Notwithstanding any Store Policies to the contrary, if your game subscription product has a dependency on non-integrated software to deliver content to your subscribers, the dependent software does not need to be available in the Store. The dependency must be disclosed at the beginning of the description metadata.
  - Notwithstanding any Store Policies to the contrary, individual games included in the subscription may be distributed from the Store or from the game service operator. While games delivered outside of the store through the game subscription are not subject to certification, they must adhere to all other applicable Store Policies.  

**10.8.7**

In cases where you determine the pricing for your product or in-app purchases, all pricing, including sales or discounting, for your digital products or services must:

- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidelines, including without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission [Guides Against Deceptive Pricing](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=676bd39fe43a808fcb417973b3d0247e&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title16/16cfr233_main_02.tpl).

- Not be priced irrationally high relative to the features and functionality provided by your product.


### 10.9 Notifications

Your product must respect system settings for notifications and remain functional when they are disabled. This includes the presentation of ads and notifications to the customer, which must also be consistent with the customer’s preferences, when provided by Windows Push Notification Service (WNS).

If your product uses WINS or web push to transmits notifications, it must comply with the following requirements:

**10.9.1**

Because notifications provided through WNS or MPNS are considered product content, they are subject to all Store Policies.

**10.9.2**

You may not obscure or try to disguise the source of any notification initiated by your product.

**10.9.3**

You may not include in a notification any information a customer would reasonably consider to be confidential or sensitive.

**10.9.4**

Notifications sent from your product must relate to the product or to other products you publish in the Store catalog, may link only to the product or the Store catalog listing of your other products, and may not include promotional messages of any kind that are not related to your products.

You must check the list at least every 30 days to ensure you receive all delete requests and must use the information provided on the list only to satisfy the delete requests of end users. You can find details about this process at 
 [Deleted Account List Tools](https://forums.xboxlive.com/users/login.html).

This information is required to be accurate and current.
