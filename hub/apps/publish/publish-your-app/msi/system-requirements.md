In this section, you have the option to indicate if certain hardware features are required or recommended to run and interact with your app properly.

Selected requirements will be displayed in your product's Store listing as required hardware. The Store may also display a warning to customers who are viewing your app's listing on a device that does not have the required hardware. Users who do not have the required hardware will be able to download your app, but they will not be able to rate or review your app on those devices.

Recommended hardware will be displayed in your product's Store listing as recommended hardware.

> [!TIP]
> You'll have a chance to specify additional system requirements, such as 3D printers or USB devices, later in the submission process.
