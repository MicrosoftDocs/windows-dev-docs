# Categories and subcategories for PWA

Listing your app in the right primary category, subcategory and an optional secondary category helps customers find your app and understand more about it. Secondary category has the same list of categories as the Primary category.

You must choose the categories that best describe your app. You can optionally choose a subcategory, if available and choose an optional secondary category. If you're not sure which category to use, or you can't find one that seems to be an exact fit, choose the one that you think customers are most likely to look at when trying to find apps like yours.

If you choose **Games** for your category, you are required to select at least one subcategory (called _genre_ for games). You can choose up to 3 genres as appropriate for your game. Note that in order to publish a game to customers on Xbox, you must enable the [Xbox Live Creators Program](/gaming/xbox-live/get-started-with-creators/get-started-with-xbox-live-creators) or go through the [concept approval](/windows/uwp/gaming/concept-approval) process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you publish the app in the Games category, you won't be able to pick a different category in a new submission; it must continue to be published in the Games category (although you can change the genre selections in a new submission). Likewise, you can't choose the Games category when updating an app that you previously published in a different category.
> For apps which are not games, you must choose one category, optionally choose from any subcategories that are available and can optionally choose a secondary category. You can't select more than one subcategory or secondary category for apps which are not in the Games category. Only some categories have subcategories, and you can only use a subcategory if it belongs to the category you selected.

To change the category or subcategory of an app that's already in the Store (except for changing from **Games** to another category or vice versa), [create a new submission](./create-app-submission.md) and select the new category or subcategory.

## Categories and subcategories

**The Microsoft Store organizes apps into the following categories and subcategories.**

| Category              | Subcategory                                                                                                                                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Examples                                                                                                                          |
