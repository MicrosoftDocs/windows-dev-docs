1. Support for traditional desktop apps, such as MSI, EXE, and MSIX, without requiring any code changes or repackaging.
2. A pop-up Store that allows users to access the Store from any app or website, and install apps without leaving their current context.
3. Flexible revenue sharing options that let developers choose their own commerce platform and keep 100% of the revenue for non-gaming apps, or use Microsoft’s commerce platform and pay a competitive fee of 15% for apps and 12% for games.
4. Expanded reach to Enterprise customers over Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based service that help enterprise admins secure and manage apps and devices.
