# Define markets for MSIX app

The Microsoft Store reaches customers in over 200 countries and regions around the world. You can choose the markets in which you'd like to offer your app, with the option to customize many [pricing and availability](./price-and-availability.md) features per market or per group of markets.

For info to help make your app suitable for customers around the world, see [Guidelines for globalization](../../../design/globalizing/guidelines-and-checklist-for-globalizing-your-app.md) and [Make your app localizable](../../../design/globalizing/prepare-your-app-for-localization.md).

## Markets

By default, we'll offer your app in all possible markets, including any future markets that we may add later, at its base price.

If you prefer, you can define the specific markets in which you'd like to offer your app. To do so, select **Show options** in the **Markets** section on the **Pricing and availability** page. This will display the **Market selection** popup window, where you can choose the markets in which to offer your app.

:::image type="content" source="images/msix-market-selection.png" lightbox="images/msix-market-selection.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Pricing and availability section where you can provide details of the market, you want to make your app available to.":::

By default, all markets are selected. You can unselect individual markets to exclude them, or you can click **Unselect all** and then add individual markets of your choice. You can search for a particular market in the search bar, and you can also change the dropdown from **All markets** to **Xbox markets** if you only want to view the markets in which you can sell Xbox products. Once you’ve finished, click **OK** to save your selections.

Note that your selections here apply only to new acquisitions; if someone already has your app in a certain market, and you later remove that market, the people who already have the app in that market can continue to use it, but they won’t get the updates you submit, and no new customers in that market can get your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is your responsibility to meet any local legal requirements, even if those requirements aren't listed here or in Partner Center.
> Keep in mind that even if you select all markets, local laws and restrictions or other factors may prevent certain apps from being listed in some countries and regions. Also, some markets may have specific requirements related to age ratings. If your app doesn’t meet these requirements, we won't be able to offer your app in that market. See [Age ratings](./age-ratings.md) for more info.

> [!NOTE]
> You will also see a checkbox that lets you indicate whether to offer your app in any market that the Store may add in the future. If you leave this box checked, and we later add new markets, the base price and general availability date for your submission will be used for your app in those markets. If you don't want this to happen, you can uncheck this box, in which case we will not list your app in any future markets (though you can always add them later).

## Microsoft Store consumer markets

You can choose to list your app (or add-on) in one or more of the following markets. The markets with an asterisk support the Microsoft Store on Xbox One; you'll see **Xbox** next to their names in the **Market selection** popup window.

## Price considerations for specific markets

Payment methods such as gift cards and mobile operator billing can help increase sales of paid apps and in-app purchase items. Due to the higher costs to enable such payment methods, a Commerce Expansion Adjustment is added to the Store Fee deducted from Net Receipts to calculate the App Proceeds payable for paid apps and in-app purchase transactions in the countries/regions and using the payment methods in the tables below. You may want to consider if the Commerce Expansion Adjustment applies in a country/region where your app is available and factor that into your market pricing strategy. Details about the Commerce Expansion Adjustment can be found in the [App Developer Agreement](/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement).

The Commerce Expansion Adjustment will be applied to all transactions processed for the specified Country/Region and Payment Methods as of the Effective Date. This information will be updated monthly; new countries/regions and payment methods will be listed within thirty (30) days after the Commerce Expansion Adjustment takes effect for that country/region and payment method.
