# Analyze performance for MSI or EXE apps

In [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/apps-and-games/overview), you have access to detailed analytics for your MSI or EXE application. Utilize statistics and charts to monitor the performance of your applications including insights into customer reach and feedback. You can also explore metrics related to app discoverability, health, usage, and other relevant data. 

You can view analytic reports right in Partner Center or download the reports you need, to analyze your data offline. When viewing your analytic reports, you'll see an arrow icon within each chart for which you can download data. Click the arrow to generate a downloadable .tsv file, which you can open in Microsoft Excel or another program that supports tab-separated values (TSV) files.
