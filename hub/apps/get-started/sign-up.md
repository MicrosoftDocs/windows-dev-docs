# Create a developer account

[Register now](/microsoft-store/register/) for a developer account so you can publish your apps to the Microsoft Store and participate in other Microsoft programs.

## Opening your developer account

We offer [individual and company accounts](../publish/partner-center/account-types-locations-and-fees.md) in locations around the world. Check out the [overview of the sign-up process](../publish/partner-center/open-a-developer-account.md) to see how it works.

## Have a name for your app?

As soon as you open your developer account, you can [create your app by reserving a name](../publish/publish-your-app/reserve-your-apps-name.md).
