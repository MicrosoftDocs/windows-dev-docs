The Van Arsdel, Ltd. end-to-end Windows sample app was built to showcase the next wave of the Microsoft Fluent Design System. It makes extensive use of the improved density and new controls in the [Windows UI Library](windows/apps/winui/) as well as powerful underlying features of the UX framework and composition. The sample shows how you can build a rich, productive experience for managing and purchasing IoT devices (in this case, lamps).
