# Title bar

The title bar sits at the top of an app on the [base layer](../signature-experiences/layering.md). Its main purpose is to allow users to be able to identify the app via its title, move the app window, and minimize, maximize, or close the app.

## Standard design

Design features of a standard title bar:

- 32px height
- 16px app icon
- Caption style text (see [XAML type ramp](../style/xaml-theme-resources.md#the-xaml-type-ramp))
- Caption controls (minimize, maximize, close)

## Additional design patterns

### Back button

If a backstack is present, the back button should be placed to the left of the app title or image/title combination.

### Search

If global search functionality is present, a searchbox should be added to the titlebar, centered to the window. Increase the size of the title bar to 48px when including a searchbox.

Searchbox in this area will need to be designed to be responsive to react to window size changes.

### People

If account representation is present, the person-picture control should be placed to the left of the caption controls.

### Tabs

If using tabs as the main element of an app, use the titlebar space and keep caption controls anchored to the right.
