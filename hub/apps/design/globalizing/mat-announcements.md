## Multilingual App Toolkit 4.1 Editor

Multilingual App Toolkit 4.1 Editor updates released.

### MAT 4.1 Editor audience

The Multilingual App Toolkit Editor is a dedicated localization editor for human translators that, through its support for XLIFF, is not limited to any product or business category.

Although this editor is a part of the Multilingual App Toolkit and can be incorporated into workflows using the MAT Visual Studio extension, the use of Visual Studio is not a requirement. For example, this editor can be leveraged by Microsoft Dynamics 365 Translation Service (DTS) users to revise the output of machine translations produced by DTS.

### What's new in the MAT 4.1 Editor

- Allow installation without Visual Studio as a pre-requisite.
- Allow users to configure MS Translator provider from the UI.
- Re-enable Language Portal as a translation provider.
- Redesign of telemetry collection to satisfy current compliance requirements.

For more details, see [Multilingual App Toolkit Editor](multilingual-app-toolkit-editor-downloads.md).

### Download MAT 4.1 Editor
