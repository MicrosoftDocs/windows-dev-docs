# Style for Windows apps

Style is what makes your app stand out. The style guidelines in this section help you create a Fluent Design through color, typography, and new features such as acrylic material and reveal highlight.

We use the [WinUI](../../winui/index.md) to deliver the latest styles across our UI components. Be sure to use the latest WinUI version to keep your apps up-to-date with the current Windows app Fluent styles. For more info about how to do this, see [XAML styles](../style/xaml-styles.md).
