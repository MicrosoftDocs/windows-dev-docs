## Principles for great app icons

### Keep it simple

**Create clean, straightforward, timeless designs** - Icons are quick visual cues that represent your app. simple, easy to understand designs help users recognize your app more quickly,

### Keep it universal

**Make it accessible, inviting, and easy to understand** - Avoid complex or overly abstract forms. An intricate shape may be appropriate in some cultures but not in others. Inclusive icons are better for everyone. We focus on human unifiers – our motivations, relationships, and capabilities. We design to extend human abilities and create a sense of belonging.

### Do less, better

**When every detail is thoughtfully crafted, delight happens** - The best apps offer beautiful design and reliable experiences. Your icon should illustrate app in a singular element using simple forms.
