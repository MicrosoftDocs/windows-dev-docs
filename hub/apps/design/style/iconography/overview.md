## Principles for great app icons

### Keep it simple

**Create clean, straightforward, timeless designs** &mdash; Icons are quick visual cues that represent your app. Simple, easy to understand designs help users recognize your app more quickly.

### Keep it universal

**Make it accessible, inviting, and easy to understand** &mdash; Avoid complex or overly abstract forms. An intricate shape may be appropriate in some cultures but not in others. Inclusive icons are better for everyone. We focus on human unifiers – our motivations, relationships, and capabilities. We design to extend human abilities and create a sense of belonging.

### Do less, better

**When every detail is thoughtfully crafted, delight happens** &mdash; The best apps offer beautiful design and reliable experiences. Your icon should illustrate your app in a singular element using simple forms.
