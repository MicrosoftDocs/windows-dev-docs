# Latest experimental channel release notes for the Windows App SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The experimental channel is **not supported** for use in production environments, and apps that use the experimental releases cannot be published to the Microsoft Store.

The experimental channel includes releases of the Windows App SDK with [experimental channel features](release-channels.md#features-available-by-release-channel) in early stages of development. APIs for experimental features have the [Experimental](/uwp/api/Windows.Foundation.Metadata.ExperimentalAttribute) attribute. If you call an experimental API in your code, you will receive a build-time warning. All APIs in the experimental channel are subject to extensive revisions and breaking changes. Experimental features and APIs may be removed from subsequent releases at any time.

**Important links**:

- If you'd like to upgrade an existing app from an older version of the Windows App SDK to a newer version, see [Update existing projects to the latest release of the Windows App SDK](update-existing-projects-to-the-latest-release.md).
- For documentation on experimental releases, see [Install tools for preview and experimental channels of the Windows App SDK](preview-experimental-install.md).

## Version 1.6 Experimental (1.6.0-experimental2)

This is the latest release of the experimental channel.

To download, retarget your WinAppSDK NuGet version to `1.6.240701003-experimental2`.

> [!NOTE]
> Phi Silica and OCR APIs are not included in this release. These will be coming in a future 1.6 release.

### Native AOT support updates

In 1.6-experimental1, the XAML compiler was generating `XamlTypeInfo.g.cs` with code that wasnâ€™t safe for AOT/Trimming. This relates to GitHub issue [#9675](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/9675), though it does not fully fix that issue.

### Changed Edge WebView2 SDK Integration

The Windows App SDK now consumes the Edge WebView2 SDK as a NuGet reference rather than embedding a hardcoded version of the Edge WebView2 SDK. The new model allows apps to choose a newer version of the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package instead of being limited to the version with which the Windows App SDK was built. The new model also allows apps to reference NuGet packages which also reference the Edge WebView2 SDK. For more info, see GitHub issue [#5689](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/5689).

### New Package Deployment APIs

The Package Management API has received several enhancements including Is\*ReadyOrNewerAvailable\*(), EnsureReadyOptions.RegisterNewerIfAvailable, Is\*Provisioned\*(), IsPackageRegistrationPending(), and several bug fixes. See [PackageManagement.md](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/packagemanager/PackageManagement.md) and [Pull Request #4453](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4453) for more details. 

### Other notable changes

- Starting with 1.6-experimental2, the latest WinUI 3 source will now publish to the main branch in the microsoft-ui-xaml GitHub repo, which will enable source searching in that repo.
- We added a new `ColorHelper.ToDisplayName()` API, filling that gap from UWP.
    - **Known issue:** Some language translations have character encoding issues. This will be fixed in the next 1.6 release.
- Added a new `Microsoft.Windows.Globalization.ApplicationLanguages` class, which notably includes a new `PrimaryLanguageOverride` feature. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4523](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4523).
- New extensions enable Widget Providers to provide Widgets with web content and announcements for Widgets.

### Known issues

- For TabView tab tear-out, pointer input behavior for *CanTearOutTabs* is incorrect on monitors with scale factor different from 100%. This will be fixed in the next 1.6 release.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue from 1.6-experimental1 where `NumberBox` wasn't using the correct foreground and background colors. For more info, see GitHub issue [#9714](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/9714).
- Fixed an issue where duplicate `KeyUp` events were raised for arrow and tab keys. For more info, see GitHub issue [#9399](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/9399).
- Fixed an issue where the `PowerManager.SystemSuspendStatusChanged` event was unusable to get the `SystemSuspendStatus`. For more info, see GitHub issue [#2833](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/2833).
- Fixed an issue where initial keyboard focus was not correctly given to a `WebView2` when that was the only control in the window.
- Fixed an issue when using `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar=true` where the Min/Max/Close buttons did not correctly appear in the UI Automation, which prevented Voice Access from showing numbers for those buttons.
- Fixed an issue where an app might crash in a lock check due to unexpected reentrancy.
- Fixed an issue from 1.6-experimental1 where `TitleBar` only showed the Icon and Title because some elements did not show up on load.
- Fixed an issue where `Hyperlink` colors did not correctly update when switching into a high contrast theme.
- Fixed an issue where changing the collection of a `ListView` in a background window may incorrectly move that window to the foreground and take focus.
- Fixed an issue from 1.6-experimental1 where setting `AcrylicBrush.TintLuminosityOpacity` in .xaml in a class library project would crash with a type conversion error.
- Fixed an issue where calling `ItemsRepeater.StartBringIntoView` could sometimes cause items to disappear.
- Fixed an issue where touching and dragging on a `Button` in a `ScrollViewer` would leave it in a pressed state.
- Updated IntelliSense, which was missing information for many newer types and members.

## Version 1.6 Experimental (1.6.0-experimental1)

This is the latest release of the experimental channel.

To download, retarget your WinAppSDK NuGet version to `1.6.240531000-experimental1`.

### Required C# project changes for 1.6-experimental1

In 1.6-experimental1, Windows App SDK managed apps require [Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref) `*.*.*.35-preview` (or later), which can be specified via [WindowsSdkPackageVersion](/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/5.0/override-windows-sdk-package-version) in your `csproj` file. For example:

```XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
   <PropertyGroup>
       <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
       <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0</TargetFramework>
       <TargetPlatformMinVersion>10.0.17763.0</TargetPlatformMinVersion>
       <WindowsSdkPackageVersion>10.0.22621.35-preview</WindowsSdkPackageVersion>
   <PropertyGroup>
   ...
```

In addition, Windows App SDK managed apps using C#/WinRT should update to [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) `2.1.0-prerelease.240602.1` (or later).

### Native AOT support

The .NET `PublishAot` project property is now supported for native Ahead-Of-Time compilation. For details, see [Native AOT Deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/). Because AOT builds on Trimming support, much of the following trimming-related guidance applies to AOT as well.

For `PublishAot` support, in addition to the C# project changes described in the previous section you'll also need a package reference to [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) `2.1.0-prerelease.240602.1` (or later) to enable the source generator from that package. 

Because the Windows App SDK invokes publishing targets when F5 deploying, we recommend enabling `PublishAot` at NuGet restore time by adding this to your `csproj` file:

```XML
<PublishAot Condition="'$(ExcludeRestorePackageImports)'=='true'">true</PublishAot>
```

In addition, we recommend conditionally enabling `PublishAot` when publishing release configurations, either in publish profiles or the project:

```XML
<PublishAot Condition="'$(Configuration)'=='Release'">true</PublishAot>
```

#### Resolving AOT Issues

In this release, the developer is responsible for ensuring that all types are properly rooted to avoid trimming (such as with reflection-based `{Binding}` targets). Later releases will enhance both C#/WinRT and the XAML Compiler to automate rooting where possible, alert developers to trimming risks, and provide mechanisms to resolve.

##### Partial Classes

C#/WinRT also includes `PublishAot` support in version 2.1.0-prerelease.240602.1. To enable a class for AOT publishing with C#/WinRT, it must first be marked `partial`. This allows the C#/WinRT AOT source analyzer to attribute the classes for static analysis. Only classes (which contain methods, the targets of trimming) require this attribute.

##### Reflection-Free Techniques

To enable AOT compatibility, reflection-based techniques should be replaced with statically typed serialization, AppContext.BaseDirectory, typeof(), etc. For details, see [Introduction to trim warnings](/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/fixing-warnings).

##### Rooting Types

Until full support for `{Binding}` is implemented, types may be preserved from trimming as follows:
Given project `P` consuming assembly `A` with type `T` in namespace `N`, which is only dynamically referenced (so normally trimmed), `T` can be preserved via:

`P.csproj`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <TrimmerRootDescriptor Include="ILLink.Descriptors.xml" />
</ItemGroup>
```

`ILLink.Descriptors.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<linker>
    <assembly fullname="A">
        <type fullname="N.T" preserve="all" />
    </assembly>
</linker>
```

For complete root descriptor XML expression syntax, see [Root Descriptors](/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options?pivots=dotnet-8-0#root-descriptors).

> [!NOTE]
> Dependency packages that have not yet adopted AOT support may exhibit runtime issues.

### Improved TabView tab tear-out

`TabView` supports a new `CanTearOutTabs` mode which provides an enhanced experience for dragging tabs and dragging out to a new window. When this new option is enabled, tab dragging is very much like the tab drag experience in Edge and Chrome, where a new window is immediately created during the drag, allowing the user to drag it to the edge of the screen to maximize or snap the window in one smooth motion. This implementation also doesn't use drag-and-drop APIs, so it isn't impacted by any limitations in those APIs. Notably, tab tear-out is supported in processes running elevated as Administrator.

**Known issue:** In this release, pointer input behavior for `CanTearOutTabs` is incorrect on monitors with scale factor different than 100%. This will be fixed in the next 1.6 release.

### New TitleBar control

A new `TitleBar` control makes it easy to create a great, customizable titlebar for your app with the following features:

- Configurable Icon, Title, and Subtitle properties
- An integrated back button
- The ability to add a custom control like a search box
- Automatic hiding and showing of elements based on window width
- Affordances for showing active or inactive window state
- Support for default titlebar features including draggable regions in empty areas, theme responsiveness, default caption (min/max/close) buttons, and built-in accessibility support

The `TitleBar` control is designed to support various combinations of titlebars, making it flexible to create the experience you want without having to write a lot of custom code. We took feedback from the [community toolkit titlebar prototype](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-Windows/discussions/454) and look forward to additional feedback!

**Known issue:** In this release, the `TitleBar` only shows the Icon and Title due to an issue where some elements don't show up on load. To work around this, use the following code to load the other elements (Subtitle, Header, Content, and Footer):

```C#
public MainWindow()
  {
      this.InitializeComponent();
      this.ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar = true;
      this.SetTitleBar(MyTitleBar);

      MyTitleBar.Loaded += MyTitleBar_Loaded;
  }

  private void MyTitleBar_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
  {
      // Parts get delay loaded. If you have the parts, make them visible.
      VisualStateManager.GoToState(MyTitleBar, "SubtitleTextVisible", false);
      VisualStateManager.GoToState(MyTitleBar, "HeaderVisible", false);
      VisualStateManager.GoToState(MyTitleBar, "ContentVisible", false);
      VisualStateManager.GoToState(MyTitleBar, "FooterVisible", false);

      // Run layout so we re-calculate the drag regions.
      MyTitleBar.InvalidateMeasure();
  }
```

This issue will be fixed in the next 1.6 release.

### Other notable changes

- Unsealed `ItemsWrapGrid`. This should be a backward-compatible change.
- `PipsPager` supports a new mode where it can wrap between the first and list items.
- `RatingControl` is now more customizable, by moving some hard-coded style properties to theme resources. This allows apps to override these values to better customize the appearance of RatingControl.

### New APIs for 1.6-experimental1
