> The Windows App SDK Visual Studio Extensions (VSIX) are no longer distributed as a separate download. They are available in the Visual Studio Marketplace inside Visual Studio.

## Version 0.8

The latest available release of the 0.8.x lineage of the stable channel of the Windows App SDK is version 0.8.12.

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows App SDK was previously known by the code name **Project Reunion**. Some SDK assets in version 0.8 and earlier still use the code name. Some areas of the documentation still use **Project Reunion** when referring to an existing asset or a specified earlier release.

### Version 0.8.8

This is a servicing release of the Windows App SDK that includes critical bug fixes for the 0.8.0 release.

> [!NOTE]
> For C# developers, one of the following .NET SDK versions (or later) is required: 6.0.202, 6.0.104, 5.0.407, 5.0.213. To update your .NET SDK version, visit [.NET Downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or update to the latest version of Visual Studio. Without the required .NET SDK version, when updating your NuGet package you will see an error like: *"This version of WindowsAppSDK requires WinRT.Runtime.dll version 1.6 or greater."*.

#### Bug fixes (0.8.8)

- Fixed touch input issues in TextBox regarding soft keyboard and general interaction. These issues also affected keyboard shortcuts. For more information, see [issue 6291](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/6291) on GitHub.

### Version 0.8.7

This is a servicing release of the Windows App SDK that includes several performance updates for C#/.NET applications. To update to this version, you'll need to reference the latest Windows SDK package version. To do that, add the property `<WindowsSdkPackageVersion>10.0.<sdk_version>.24</WindowsSdkPackageVersion>` to your `.csproj` file with the SDK version your app is targeting from the `TargetFramework` property. For example:

 ```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net6.0-windows10.0.19041.0</TargetFramework>
        <TargetPlatformMinVersion>10.0.17763.0</TargetPlatformMinVersion>
        <WindowsSdkPackageVersion>10.0.19041.24</WindowsSdkPackageVersion>
    <PropertyGroup>
    ...
 ```

This version of the Windows SDK projection will be available in an upcoming .NET 6 servicing release. After that .NET SDK update is available, you should remove the `<WindowsSdkPackageVersion>` property from your project file.

If you don't set this property, then you'll see an error like: `"Error: This version of Project Reunion requires WinRT.Runtime.dll version 1.6 or greater."`

### Version 0.8.6

This is a servicing release of the Windows App SDK that includes several performance improvements for C#/.NET applications for the 0.8.0 release.

To update to this version of Windows App SDK, you will need to have the latest .NET SDK December update installed (see [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and [.NET 5 will reach End of Support on May 10, 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-5-end-of-support-update/)). If you don't have the minimum required version of the .NET SDK installed, then you'll see an error like `"Error: This version of Project Reunion requires WinRT.Runtime.dll version 1.4 or greater."`

#### Bug Fixes (0.8.6)

For a detailed list of the performance improvements, see the [C#/WinRT 1.4.1 release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/releases/tag/1.4.1.211117.1).

### Version 0.8.0 Stable

#### New features and updates

This release supports all [stable channel features](../release-channels.md#features-available-by-release-channel).

**WinUI 3:**

This release includes many bug fixes and improved stabilization across WinUI 3. These are all of the new changes in WinUI 3 since the release of WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5:

- The Pivot control has been added back in and can now be used in any WinUI 3 app.
- All bug fixes from Project Reunion v0.5.5, v0.5.6, and v0.5.7 are included with this release.
- New bug fixes, including:
  - Mouse right-click in TextBox crashes the application
  - NavigationView causes crash in UWP, Reunion 0.5 Preview
  - ProgressBar doesn't show difference between Paused and Error option
  - Crash in RichEditBox when copying/pasting/changing text style
  - Window caption buttons are misplaced when SetTitleBar is not set or null

  **For the full list of bugs addressed in this release, see [our GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/winui3/0.8/bugs-fixed).**

- The `ColorHelper.ToDisplayName` API is no longer available.
- The following types have been removed:
  - `Microsoft.Graphics.IGeometrySource2D`
  - `Microsoft.Graphics.IGeometrySource2DInterop`

  Use `Windows.Graphics.IGeometrySource2D` and `Windows.Graphics.IGeometrySource2DInterop` instead.

- All types in the `Microsoft.System` namespace have been moved to the `Microsoft.UI.Dispatching` namespace, including the [DispatcherQueue class](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.dispatching.dispatcherqueue).

- The `AcrylicBrush.BackgroundSource` property has been removed, since `HostBackdrop` is not supported as a `BackgroundSource` in WinUI 3.

For more information on WinUI, see [WinUI](../../winui/index.md).

To see WinUI 3 controls and features in action, you can clone and build the WinUI 3 Gallery app [from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery/tree/main), or download the app [from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P3JFPWWDZRC).

To get started developing with WinUI, check out the following articles:

- [WinUI 3 templates in Visual Studio](../../winui/winui3/winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md)
- [Create your first WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK) project](../../winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app.md)
- [Build a C# .NET app with WinUI 3 and Win32 interop](../../winui/winui3/desktop-winui3-app-with-basic-interop.md)
- [WinUI 3 API Reference](/windows/winui/api)

**DWriteCore:**

This release of DWriteCore includes the following new and updated features. DWriteCore is introduced and described in the [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview).

- DWriteCore now has support for underline&mdash;see [**IDWriteTextLayout::GetUnderline**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-getunderline) and [**IDWriteTextLayout::SetUnderline**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-setunderline).
- Support for strikethrough&mdash;see [**IDWriteTextLayout::GetStrikethrough**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-getstrikethrough) and [**IDWriteTextLayout::SetStrikethrough**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-setstrikethrough).
- Support for vertical text via [**IDWriteTextLayout**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextlayout)&mdash;see [Vertical text](/windows/win32/directwrite/vertical-text).
- All of the methods of the [**IDWriteTextAnalyzer**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextanalyzer) and [**IDWriteTextAnalyzer1**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/nn-dwrite_1-idwritetextanalyzer1) interfaces are implemented.
- The [**DWriteCoreCreateFactory**](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/win32/dwrite_core/nf-dwrite_core-dwritecorecreatefactory) free function creates a factory object that is used for subsequent creation of individual DWriteCore objects.

> [!NOTE]
> [**DWriteCoreCreateFactory**](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/win32/dwrite_core/nf-dwrite_core-dwritecorecreatefactory) is functionally the same as the [**DWriteCreateFactory**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-dwritecreatefactory) function exported by the system version of DirectWrite. The DWriteCore function has a different name to avoid ambiguity in the event that you link both `DWriteCore.lib` and `DWrite.lib`.

For DWriteCore and DirectWrite API reference, see [DWriteCore API Reference](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/win32/_dwritecore/) and [DirectWrite API Reference](/windows/win32/directwrite/reference).

**MRTCore:**

- The **Build Action** for resources is automatically set when you add the resource to your project, reducing the need for manual project configuration.

#### Limitations

- This release is not currently supported on the Dev Channel of the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com). **This is fixed in version 0.8.1**.

- Desktop apps (C# or C++ desktop): This release is supported for use only in desktop apps (C++ or C#) that are packaged using MSIX. To use the Windows App SDK in unpackaged desktop apps, you must use the [experimental release channel](../experimental-channel.md).

[!INCLUDE [UWP migration guidance](./../includes/uwp-app-sdk-migration-pointer.md)]

#### Known issues

- WinUI 3 tooling such as Live Visual Tree, Live Property Explorer, and Hot Reload in version 0.8 and later requires Visual Studio 2019 16.11 Preview 3 and later.
- Apps currently using WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK 0.8 cannot use class libraries that use Project Reunion 0.5. Update the class libraries to use the Windows App SDK 0.8.
- .NET apps must target build 18362 or later: Your TFM must be set to net6.0-windows10.0.18362 or later, and your packaging project's must be set to 18362 or later. For more info, see [GitHub issue #921](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/921).
- You may encounter a crash when switching frequently between light and dark mode.
- For .NET apps, you may receive the following error when passing in an array of enums: `Object contains non-primitive or non-blittable data.` **This is fixed in version 0.8.2**.
- For .NET apps, there is currently no way  to opt out of an image getting indexed as an app resource using the Visual Studio UI. To work around this, add a Directory.Build.targets (see [Customize your build - Visual Studio](/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build) for instructions) to the project and remove the image(s) as follows:

  - To remove specific images (note that the relative path is needed):

    ```xml
    <Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <Content Remove="..\Bitmap1.bmp" />
    </ItemGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

    - To remove images based on metadata:

    ```xml
    <Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <Content Remove="@(None->WithMetadataValue('Pack','true'))" />
    </ItemGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

    A fix for this issue is planned for an upcoming release - at that point, the above workarounds will no longer be needed.
