## Visual Studio project and item templates

The [Windows App SDK](index.md) includes Visual Studio project and item templates for creating and developing WinUI 3 apps.

### [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1 and later](#tab/vs-2022-17-1-b)

If you followed the instructions in [Required workloads and components](#required-workloads-and-components) above, then the templates are already installed.

### [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0](#tab/vs-2022-17-0)

The templates are available by installing a Visual Studio extension (VSIX).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Windows App SDK Visual Studio extension (VSIX) already installed, then uninstall it before installing a new version. For directions, see [Manage extensions for Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions).

Download the extension directly, and install it:

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C# stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cs)

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C++ stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cpp)

### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/vs-2019)

The templates are available by installing a Visual Studio extension (VSIX).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Windows App SDK Visual Studio extension (VSIX) already installed, then uninstall it before installing a new version. For directions, see [Manage extensions for Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions).

* You can install the latest stable release VSIX from Visual Studio. Click **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**, search for *Windows App SDK*, and download the Windows App SDK extension. Close and reopen Visual Studio, and follow the prompts to install the extension.
* Alternatively, you can download the extension directly from Visual Studio Marketplace, and install it:
