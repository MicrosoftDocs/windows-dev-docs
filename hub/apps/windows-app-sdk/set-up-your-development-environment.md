# Install tools for the Windows App SDK

Configure your development computer by installing the appropriate tools to develop apps for Windows with the [Windows App SDK](./index.md) and [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/).

> [!NOTE]
> This article is for the stable release channel of the Windows App SDK. See [Windows App SDK release channels](./release-channels.md). For other channels, see [Install tools for preview and experimental channels of the Windows App SDK](./preview-experimental-install.md).

## Install tools with winget

To install the required tools and workloads using the command line, enter one of the following commands in the console. This is supported only with Visual Studio 2022 and later. If you already have Visual Studio 2022 or later installed, then the command will open Visual Studio Installer with any missing workloads selected. You can then select **Modify** in the Visual Studio Installer to install the required workloads.

### For C# developers

#### [Visual Studio Community](#tab/cs-vs-community)

```console
winget install "Visual Studio Community 2022"  --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.WindowsAppSDK.Cs" -s msstore
```

#### [Visual Studio Enterprise](#tab/cs-vs-enterprise)

```console
winget install "Visual Studio Enterprise 2022"  --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.WindowsAppSDK.Cs"
```

## Visual Studio project and item templates

The [Windows App SDK](index.md) includes Visual Studio project and item templates for creating and developing apps that use the WinUI 3 library to implement the user interface.

### [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1 and later](#tab/vs-2022-17-1-b)

If you followed the instructions in [Required workloads and components](#required-workloads-and-components) above, then the templates are already installed.

Select **C#** or **C++** as the language, **Windows** as the platform, and **WinUI** as the Project type to create a new Windows App SDK project.

Optionally, install [Template Studio for WinUI (C#)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TemplateStudio.TemplateStudioForWinUICs) to accelerate the creation of new .NET WinUI apps using a wizard-based UI. Select from a variety of project types and features to generate a project template customized for you.

### [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0](#tab/vs-2022-17-0)

The templates are available by installing a Visual Studio extension (VSIX).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Windows App SDK Visual Studio extension (VSIX) already installed, then uninstall it before installing a new version. For directions, see [Manage extensions for Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions).

Download the extension directly, and install it:

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C# stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cs)

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C++ stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cpp)

### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/vs-2019)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Visual Studio 2019 only supports Windows App SDK 1.1 and earlier. Visual Studio 2022 is recommended for developing apps with all versions of the Windows App SDK.

The templates are available by installing a Visual Studio extension (VSIX).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Windows App SDK Visual Studio extension (VSIX) already installed, then uninstall it before installing a new version. For directions, see [Manage extensions for Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions).

* You can install the latest stable release VSIX from Visual Studio. Select **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**, search for *Windows App SDK*, and download the Windows App SDK extension. Close and reopen Visual Studio, and follow the prompts to install the extension.
* Alternatively, you can download the extension directly from Visual Studio Marketplace, and install it:

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C# stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2019-cs)

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C++ stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2019-cpp)

## Hybrid C/C++ runtime library linkage

In releases 1.0.3 and 1.1 Preview 2 and later, the Windows App SDK uses Hybrid C/C++ runtime library linkage (hybrid CRT linkage). This is a CRT linkage technique that simplifies deployment. Whether you're a C++ application developer or a C++ library developer, here are some resources for learning about hybrid CRT linkage:

* [Hybrid CRT linkage coding guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/docs/Coding-Guidelines/HybridCRT.md) on GitHub.
* The hybrid CRT linkage segment of the [WinUI community call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNHGU6xmUzE&t=977s) from April 20, 2022.

## Next steps

To create your first WinUI 3 app that uses the Windows App SDK, see [Create your first WinUI 3 project](../winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app.md).
