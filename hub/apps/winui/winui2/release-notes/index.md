# WinUI 2 Release Notes

WinUI is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml) where we encourage you to file bug reports, feature requests and community code contributions.

WinUI includes two NuGet packages:

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml): Controls and Fluent Design for UWP apps. This is the main WinUI package.

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct): Low-level APIs for use in middleware components.

You can download and use WinUI packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see [Getting Started with WinUI](/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) for more information.

## Examples

> [!TIP]
> For more info, design guidance, and code examples, see [Design and code Windows apps](../../../design/index.md).
>
> The **WinUI 2 Gallery** app includes interactive examples of most WinUI 2 controls, features, and functionality.
>
> If the gallery app is installed already, click [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](winui2gallery:) to open it.
>
> If not installed, download the [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVH128X2ZT) from the Microsoft Store.
>
> You can also get the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinUI-Gallery) (select the *winui2* branch).

## Documentation

How-to articles for WinUI controls are included with the [Universal Windows Platform controls documentation](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/).

API reference docs are located here: [WinUI APIs](/windows/winui/api/).
