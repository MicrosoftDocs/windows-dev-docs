## Instructions for packaged C# WinUI 3 apps

To create a packaged WinUI 3 desktop app with C# and .NET 5 using Windows App SDK 1.0:

1. In Visual Studio, select **File** -> **New** -> **Project**.

2. In the project drop-down filters, select **C#**, **Windows**, and **WinUI**, respectively.

3. Select one of the following project types and click **Next**.

    - **Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop)**: Creates a desktop C# .NET app with a WinUI-based user interface. The generated project is configured with the package manifest and other support needed to build the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview) without the use of a separate packaging project. For more information about this project type, see [Package your app using single-project MSIX](../../windows-app-sdk/single-project-msix.md).

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you installed the Windows App SDK 1.0 Preview 2 with Visual Studio 2019, this project template has a known issue that results in a build error. To resolve this issue, install the [Single-project MSIX Packaging Tools for Visual Studio 2019 VSIX extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProjectReunion.MicrosoftSingleProjectMSIXPackagingTools) after you install the Windows App SDK 1.0 Preview 2.

    - **Blank App, Packaged with Windows Application Packaging Project (WinUI 3 in Desktop)**: Creates a desktop C# .NET app with a WinUI-based user interface. The generated solution includes a separate [Windows Application Packaging Project](/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net) that is configured to build the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview).

4. Enter a project name, choose any other options as desired, and click **Create**.

5. In the following dialog box, set the **Target version** to Windows 10, version 2004 (build 19041) and **Minimum version** to Windows 10, version 1809 (build 17763) and then click **OK**.

    ![Target and Min Version](images/WinUI3-minversion.png)

6. At this point, Visual Studio generates one or more projects:

    - **_Project name_ (Desktop)**: This project contains your app's code. The **App.xaml** file and **App.xaml.cs** code-behind file define an `Application` class that represents your app instance. The **MainWindow.xaml** file and **MainWindow.xaml.cs** code-behind file define a `MainWindow` class that represents the main window displayed by your app. These classes derive from types in the **Microsoft.UI.Xaml** namespace provided by WinUI.

        If you used the **Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop)** project template, this project also includes the package manifest for building the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview).

        ![Screenshot of Visual Studio showing the Solution Explorer pane and the contents of the Main Windows X A M L dot C S file for single project M S I X.](images/WinUI-csharp-appproject-1.0-later.png)

    - **_Project name_ (Package)**: This project is generated only if you use the **Blank App, Packaged with Windows Application Packaging Project (WinUI 3 in Desktop)** project template. This project is a [Windows Application Packaging Project](/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net) that is configured to build the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview). This project contains the [package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/schema-root) for your app, and it is the startup project for your solution by default.

        ![Screenshot of Visual Studio showing the Solution Explorer pane and the contents of the Package app x manifest file.](images/WinUI-csharp-packageproject.png)

7. To add a new item to your app project, right-click the **_Project name_ (Desktop)** project node in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add** -> **New Item**. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select the **WinUI** tab, choose the item you want to add, and then click **Add**. For more details about the available items, see [Item templates for WinUI 3](winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md#item-templates-for-winui-3).

    ![Screenshot of the Add New Item dialog box with the Installed > Visual C sharp Items > Win U I selected and the Blank Page option highlighted.](images/winui3-addnewitem.png)

8. Build and run your solution on your development computer to confirm that the app runs without errors.

## Instructions for unpackaged C# WinUI 3 apps

To create an unpackaged WinUI 3 desktop app with C# and .NET 5 using Windows App SDK 1.0:

1. Install the [Windows App SDK runtime and MSIX packages](../../windows-app-sdk/downloads.md). These are required to run and deploy your [unpackaged](../../windows-app-sdk/deploy-unpackaged-apps.md) app.

2. Create a new app using the "Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop)" project template. Starting with a packaged app is required to use XAML diagnostics.

3. Add this property to the project file:

   ```xml
   <WindowsPackageType>None</WindowsPackageType>
   ```

    :::image type="content" source="images/winui-csharp-unpackaged-proj.png" alt-text="Visual Studio 2019 - C# Project file with WindowsPackageType set to None highlighted":::
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Adding `<WindowsPackageType>None</WindowsPackageType>` will break the bootstrapper in WinUI 3 `v1.0`. While we work on a fix, apply the following workaround as `WinUiBootstrapperFix.cs` in the root of your project.

    ```cs
    global using Version = Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.Runtime.Fix.Version;
    namespace Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.Runtime.Fix;

    public class Version
    {
        public const ushort Major = 0;
        public const ushort Minor = 319;
        public const ushort Build = 455;
        public const ushort Revision = 0;
        public const ulong UInt64 = 0x0000013F01C70000;
        public const string DotQuadString = "0.319.455.0";
    }
    ```

4. To debug in Visual Studio, select the 'Unpackaged' launch profile in the Start drop down.
   Otherwise, you'll see an error: "The project doesn't know how to run the profile â€¦"

    > [!NOTE]
    > This isn't necessary if you execute the application (`.exe`) from the command line or Windows File explorer.
  
      :::image type="content" source="images/winui3-csharp-launch-profile.png" alt-text="Visual Studio - Start drop down with C# application unpackaged launch profile highlighted":::

5. If you haven't already done so, **install the Windows App SDK runtime and MSIX packages, which are required to run and deploy your app.**
    > [!div class="button"]
    > [Download latest installer & MSIX packages](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.0-stable/msix-installer)

6. Build and run. See the Windows App SDK tutorial for [deploying unpackaged C# apps](../../windows-app-sdk/tutorial-unpackaged-deployment.md).

7. for additional deployment information. This tutorial will guide you through using the [bootstrapper API](../../windows-app-sdk/reference-framework-package-run-time.md) to initialize the [Bootstrapper](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deployment-architecture#bootstrapper) component so your app can use Windows App SDK and WinUI 3 APIs.

## Instructions for packaged C++ WinUI 3 apps

To create a packaged WinUI 3 desktop app with C++ using Windows App SDK 1.0:

1. In Visual Studio, select **File** -> **New** -> **Project**.

2. In the project drop-down filters, select **C++**, **Windows**, and **WinUI**.

3. Select one of the following project types and click **Next**.

    - **Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop)**: Creates a desktop C++ app with a WinUI-based user interface. The generated project is configured with the package manifest and other support needed to build the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview) without the use of a separate packaging project. For more information about this project type, see [Package your app using single-project MSIX](../../windows-app-sdk/single-project-msix.md).

        > [!NOTE]
        > This project type only supports a single executable in the generated MSIX package. If you need to combine multiple executables into a single MSIX package, you must use the **Blank App, Packaged with Windows Application Packaging Project (WinUI 3 in Desktop)** project template or add a Windows Application Packaging Project to your solution.

    - **Blank App, Packaged with Windows Application Packaging Project (WinUI 3 in Desktop)**: Creates a desktop C++ app with a WinUI-based user interface. The generated solution includes a separate [Windows Application Packaging Project](/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net) that is configured to build the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview).

    ![Another screenshot of Create a new project wizard with the Blank App Packaged (Win U I in Desktop) option highlighted.](images/WinUI3-cpp-newproject-1.0-later.png)

4. Enter a project name, choose any other options as desired, and click **Create**.

5. In the following dialog box, set the **Target version** to Windows 10, version 2004 (build 19041) and **Minimum version** to Windows 10, version 1809 (build 17763) and then click **OK**.

6. At this point, Visual Studio generates one or more projects:

    - **_Project name_ (Desktop)**: This project contains your app's code. The **App.xaml** and various **App** code files define an `Application` class that represents your app instance, and the **MainWindow.xaml** and various **MainWindow** code files define a `MainWindow` class that represents the main window displayed by your app. These classes derive from types in the **Microsoft.UI.Xaml** namespace provided by WinUI.

        If you used the **Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop)** project template, this project also includes the package manifest for building the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview).

        ![Screenshot of Visual Studio showing the Solution Explorer pane and the contents of the Main Windows X A M L file for single project M S I X.](images/WinUI-cpp-appproject-1.0-later.png)

    - **_Project name_ (Package)**: This project is generated only if you use the **Blank App, Packaged with Windows Application Packaging Project (WinUI 3 in Desktop)** project template. This project is a [Windows Application Packaging Project](/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net) that is configured to build the app into an [MSIX package](/windows/msix/overview). This project contains the [package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/schema-root) for your app, and it is the startup project for your solution by default.

        ![Another screenshot of Visual Studio showing the Solution Explorer pane and the contents of the Package app x manifest file.](images/WinUI-cpp-packageproject.png)

7. To add a new item to your app project, right-click the **_Project name_ (Desktop)** project node in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add** -> **New Item**. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select the **WinUI** tab, choose the item you want to add, and then click **Add**. For more details about the available items, see [Item templates for WinUI 3](winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md#item-templates-for-winui-3).

## Instructions for unpackaged C++ WinUI 3 apps

To create an unpackaged WinUI 3 desktop app with C++ using Windows App SDK 1.0:

1. Install the [Single-project MSIX Packaging Tools](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/single-project-msix#install-the-single-project-msix-packaging-tools).

2. Install the [Windows App SDK runtime and MSIX packages](../../windows-app-sdk/downloads.md). These are required to run and deploy your [unpackaged](../../windows-app-sdk/deploy-unpackaged-apps.md) app.

3. Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (VCRedist)](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) for the appropriate architecture

    - The latest version of the redistributable is compatible with the latest Visual Studio GA release, as well as all versions of Visual Studio used to build Windows App SDK binaries.
    - Insider builds of Visual Studio may have installed a later version of VCRedist, and running the public version will then fail with this error, which can be ignored:
   **Error 0x80070666: Cannot install a product when a newer version is installed.**

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have the VCRedist installed on a target device, then dynamic links to c:\windows\system32\vcruntime140.dll will fail, which can manifest to end users in many ways.

4. Create a new app using the "Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop)" project template. Starting with a packaged app is required to use XAML diagnostics.

5. Add this property to the project file:

   ```xml
   <WindowsPackageType>None</WindowsPackageType>
   ```

6. Change 'AppxPackage' property to false:

   ```xml
    <AppxPackage>false</AppxPackage>
   ```

7. If you haven't already done so, **install the Windows App SDK runtime and MSIX packages, which are required to run and deploy your app.**
