# WinUI in the Windows App SDK (WinUI 3)

WinUI 3 is the native UI platform component that ships with the [Windows App SDK](../../windows-app-sdk/index.md) (completely decoupled from [Windows SDKs](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)). The Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools that can be used to create production desktop apps that target Windows 10 and later, and can be published to the Microsoft Store.

> [!Important]
> The **Windows App SDK** was previously known as **Project Reunion**. Some assets, such as the VSIX extension and NuGet packages, still use this code name (these will be renamed in a future release).
>
>**Windows App SDK** is used in all documentation except where a specific release or asset still refers to **Project Reunion**.

## WinUI resources

**Release notes:** For more details on the Windows App SDK, see [Latest stable channel release notes for the Windows App SDK](../../windows-app-sdk/stable-channel.md).

**Github**: WinUI is hosted on Github. Use the [WinUI repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml), to file feature requests or bugs, and interact with the WinUI team.

## Examples

> [!TIP]
> For more info, design guidance, and code examples, see [Design and code Windows apps](../../design/index.md).
>
> The **WinUI 3 Gallery** and **WinUI 2 Gallery** apps include interactive examples of most WinUI 3 and WinUI 2 controls, features, and functionality.
>
> If installed already, open them by clicking the following links: [**WinUI 3 Gallery**](winui3gallery:/item/AnimatedIcon) or [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](winui2gallery:/item/AnimatedIcon).
>
> If they are not installed, you can download the [**WinUI 3 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P3JFPWWDZRC) and the [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVH128X2ZT) from the Microsoft Store.
>
> You can also get the source code for both from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinUI-Gallery) (use the *main* branch for WinUI 3 and the *winui2* branch for WinUI 2).
