# Overview and release notes: Windows UI Library 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 (March 2021)

Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3 is a native user experience (UX) framework for building modern Windows apps.  It ships independently from the Windows operating system as a part of [Project Reunion](../../project-reunion/index.md).  The Project Reunion 0.5 release provides [Visual Studio project templates](https://aka.ms/projectreunion/vsixdownload) to help you start building apps with a WinUI 3-based user interface.

**WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5** is the first stable, supported version of WinUI 3 that can be used to create production apps that can be published to the Microsoft Store. This release consists of the stability updates and general improvements that allow WinUI 3 to be forward-compatible and production-ready.


## Install WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5

This new version of WinUI 3 is available as part of Project Reunion 0.5. To install, see:

**[Installation instructions for Project Reunion 0.5](../../project-reunion/set-up-your-development-environment.md)**

Now that WinUI ships as a part of Project Reunion, you'll download the Project Reunion Visual Studio Extension (VSIX) to get started, which includes a set of developer tools and components. For more on the Project Reunion package, see [Deploy apps that use Project Reunion](../../project-reunion/deploy-apps-that-use-project-reunion.md). The Project Reunion VSIX includes [WinUI Project Templates](winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md) that you'll use to build your WinUI 3 app. 

> [!NOTE]
> To see WinUI 3 controls and features in action, you can clone and build the WinUI 3 version of the [XAML Controls Gallery](#winui-3-controls-gallery) from GitHub.

Once you've set up your development environment, see [WinUI 3 project templates in Visual Studio](winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md) to familiarize yourself with the available Visual Studio Project and Item templates.

For more information about getting started with building a WinUI 3 app, see the following articles:

- [Get started with WinUI 3 for desktop apps](get-started-winui3-for-desktop.md)
- [Build a basic WinUI 3 app for desktop](desktop-build-basic-winui3-app.md)

Aside from the [limitations and known issues](#limitations-and-known-issues), building an app using the WinUI projects is  similar to building a UWP app with XAML and WinUI 2.x. Therefore, most of the [guidance documentation](/windows/uwp/design/) for UWP apps and the **Windows.UI** WinRT namespaces in the Windows SDK is applicable.

WinUI 3 API reference documentation is available here: [WinUI 3 API Reference](/windows/winui/api)

### WebView2

To use WebView2 with this WinUI 3 release, please download the Evergreen Bootstrapper or Evergreen Standalone Installer found on [this page](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) if you don't already have the WebView2 Runtime installed. 

### Windows Community Toolkit

If you're using the Windows Community Toolkit, [download the latest version](https://aka.ms/wct-winui3).

### Visual Studio Support

In order to take advantage of the latest tooling features added into WinUI 3 like Hot Reload, Live Visual Tree, and Live Property Explorer, you must use a preview version of Visual Studio 2019 16.10. Please note that Visual Studio preview releases are pre-release products, so you may run into bugs and limitations when using preview versions of Visual Studio to build WinUI 3 apps.  

The table below shows the compatibility of Visual Studio 2019 versions with WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5. 

| VS Version  | WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5  |
|---|---|
| 16.8  | No   |
| 16.9  | Yes, but with no Hot Reload, Live Visual Tree, or Live Property Explorer  |
| 16.10 Previews  | Yes, with all WinUI 3 tooling (in preview)  |


## Update your existing WinUI 3 app

If you created an app with an earlier preview or release version of WinUI 3, you can update the project to use the latest release of WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5. For instructions, see [Update existing projects to the latest release of Project Reunion](../../project-reunion/update-existing-projects-to-the-latest-release.md).

## Major changes introduced in this release

### Stable features

This release provides the stability and support to make WinUI 3 suitable for production apps that can ship to the Microsoft Store. It includes support and forward compatibility for most features introduced in past previews:

- Ability to create desktop apps with WinUI, including [.NET 5](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/master/release-notes/5.0) for Win32 apps
- [RadialGradientBrush](/windows/uwp/design/style/brushes#radial-gradient-brushes)
- [TabView updates](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/tab-view)
- Dark theme updates
- Improvements and updates to [WebView2](/microsoft-edge/hosting/webview2)
  - Support for High DPI
  - Support for window resizing and moving
  - Updated to target more recent version of Edge
  - No longer necessary to reference a WebView2-specific Nuget package
- SwapChainPanel
- MRT Core Support
  - This makes apps faster and lighter on startup and provides quicker resource lookup.
- ARM64 Support
- Drag and drop inside and outside of apps
- RenderTargetBitmap (currently only XAML content - no SwapChainPanel content)
- Custom cursor support
- Off-thread input
- Improvements to our tooling/developer experience:
  - Live Visual Tree, Hot Reload, Live Property Explorer and similar tools
  - Intellisense for WinUI 3
- Improvements required for open source migration
- Custom titlebar capabilities: new [Window.ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.window.extendscontentintotitlebar) and [Window.SetTitleBar](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.window.settitlebar) APIs that allow developers to create custom title bars in desktop apps.
- VirtualSurfaceImageSource support
- In-app acrylic

### Preview features

As this is a stable release, preview features have been removed from this version of WinUI 3. You can still access these features by using the current [preview version of WinUI 3](release-notes/release-notes-08-preview.md). Please note the following key features are still in preview, and work to stabilize them is ongoing:

- UWP support
  - This means you cannot build or run a UWP app using the WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 VSIX. You'll need to use the [WinUI 3 - Project Reunion Preview VSIX](https://aka.ms/projectreunion/previewdownload), and follow the rest of the instructions for setting up your development environment in [Get started with Project Reunion](../../project-reunion/get-started-with-project-reunion.md). See  [Overview and release notes: Windows UI Library 3 - Project Reunion 0.8 Preview](release-notes/release-notes-08-preview.md) for more information.

- Multi-window support in desktop apps

- Input validation

### Provide feedback and suggestions

We welcome your feedback in the [WinUI GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/new/choose).

### What's coming next?

For more information on when specific features are planned, see the [feature roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md#winui-30-feature-roadmap) on GitHub.

## Limitations and known issues

The following items are some of the known issues with WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5. If you find an issue that isn't listed below, please let us know by contributing to an existing issue or filing a new issue through the [WinUI GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/new/choose).

### Platform and OS support

WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 is compatible with PCs running the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809 - build 17763) and newer.

### Developer tools

- Only C# and C++/WinRT apps are supported
- Desktop apps support .NET 5 and C# 9, and must be packaged in an MSIX app
- No XAML Designer support
- New C++/CX apps are not supported, however, your existing apps will continue to function (please move to C++/WinRT as soon as possible)
- Unpackaged desktop deployment is not supported
- When running a desktop app using F5, make sure that you are running the packaging project. Hitting F5 on the app project will run an unpackaged app, which WinUI 3 does not yet support.

### Missing Platform Features

- Xbox support
- HoloLens support
- Windowed popups
  - More specifically, the `ShouldConstrainToRootBounds` property always acts as if it's set to `true`, regardless of the property value.
- Inking support, including:
  - [InkCanvas](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.InkCanvas)
  - [HandwritingView](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.HandwritingView)
  - [InkPresenter](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Input.Inking.InkPresenter)
- Background acrylic
- MediaElement and MediaPlayerElement
- MapControl
- SwapChainPanel does not support transparency
-	AcrylicBrush and other effects using a CompositionBackdropBrush canâ€™t sample from a SwapChainPanel or WebView2.
- Global Reveal uses fallback behavior, a solid brush
- XAML Islands is not supported in this release
- Using WinUI 3 directly in an existing non-WinUI desktop app has the following limitation: The currently available path for migrating an existing app is to add a **new** WinUI 3 project to your solution, and adjust or refactor your logic as needed.

- Application.Suspending is not called in desktop apps. See API reference documentation on the [Application.Suspending Event](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.application.suspending?preserve-view=true&view=winui-3.0-preview) for more details. 

- CoreWindow, ApplicationView, CoreApplicationView, CoreDispatcher and their dependencies are not supported in desktop apps (see below)

### CoreWindow, ApplicationView, CoreApplicationView, and CoreDispatcher in desktop apps

New in WinUI 3 Preview 4 and standard going forward, [CoreWindow](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow), [ApplicationView](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView), [CoreApplicationView](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplicationView) [CoreDispatcher](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcher), and their dependencies are not available in desktop apps. For example, the [Window.Dispatcher](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Window.Dispatcher) property is always **null**, but the **Window.DispatcherQueue** property can be used as an alternative.

These APIs only work in UWP apps. In past previews they've partially worked in desktop apps as well, but since Preview 4 they've been fully disabled. These APIs are designed for the UWP case where there is only one window per thread, and one of the features of WinUI 3 is to enable multiple in the future.

There are APIs that internally depend on existence of these APIs, which consequently aren't supported in a desktop app. These APIs generally have a static `GetForCurrentView` method. For example [UIViewSettings.GetForCurrentView](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.UIViewSettings.GetForCurrentView).

For more information on affected APIs as well as workarounds and replacements for these APIs, please see [WinRT API changes for desktop apps](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/winrt-apis-for-desktop.md)

### Known issues

- The [UISettings.ColorValuesChanged Event](/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.uisettings.colorvalueschanged) and [AccessibilitySettings.HighContrastChanged Event](/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.accessibilitysettings.highcontrastchanged) are no longer supported in desktop apps. This may cause issues if you are using it to detect changes in Windows themes. 

- Previously, to get a CompositionCapabilities instance you would call [CompositionCapabilites.GetForCurrentView()](/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition.compositioncapabilities.getforcurrentview). However, the capabilities returned from this call were *not* dependent on the view. To address and reflect this, we've deleted the GetForCurrentView() static in this release, so now you can create a [CompositionCapabilties](/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition.compositioncapabilities) object directly.

- You may receive a build error due to mismatched versions of the .NET SDK and the winrt.runtime.dll. As a workaround, you can try the following:

  Explicitly set your .NET SDK to the correct version. To determine the correct version for your app, locate the `<TargetFramework>` tag in your project file. Using the Windows SDK build number that your app is targeting in the `<TargetFramework>` tag (such as 18362 or 19041), add the following item to your project file, then save your project: 

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>            
      <FrameworkReference Update="Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref" RuntimeFrameworkVersion="10.0.{Target Windows SDK Build Number}.16" />
      <FrameworkReference Update="Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref" TargetingPackVersion="10.0.{Target Windows SDK Build Number}.16" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

  Note this workaround is required for .NET SDK 5.0.203 and earlier, but will not be required for .NET SDK 5.0.204 or 5.0.300.

- When using Visual Studio 2019 16.10 Preview 2, Live Visual Tree may cause a crash. To avoid this, update to the latest [Visual Studio 2019 16.10 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).

## WinUI 3 Controls Gallery

Check out the WinUI 3 Controls Gallery (previously called _XAML Controls Gallery - WinUI 3 version_) for a sample app that includes all controls and features that are a part of WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5.
