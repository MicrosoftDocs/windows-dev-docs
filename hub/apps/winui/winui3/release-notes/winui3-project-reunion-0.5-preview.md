# Windows UI Library 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview (March 2021) release notes

Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3 is a native user experience (UX) platform for building modern Windows apps. This preview of WinUI 3 works with both desktop/Win32 and UWP apps, and includes Visual Studio project templates to help get started building apps with a WinUI-based user interface as well as a NuGet package that contains the WinUI libraries.

**WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview** is the first release of WinUI 3 where it's provided as a part of the Project Reunion package. Alongside that change, this preview release contains critical bug fixes, increased stability, and a few other general improvements (see **[Capabilities introduced in WinUI 3  - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview](#major-changes-introduced-in-this-release)**).

> [!Important]
> This WinUI 3 preview is intended for early evaluation and to gather feedback from the developer community. It should **NOT** be used for production apps.
>
> We expect to ship Project Reunion 0.5 in late March, which will include the first stable, supported version of WinUI 3.
>
> Please use the [WinUI GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml) to provide feedback and log suggestions and issues.

## Install WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview

This version of WinUI 3 is available as part of the Project Reunion 0.5 Preview. 

To install, follow the directions found in the [Set up your development environment](../../../project-reunion/set-up-your-development-environment.md) guide for Project Reunion. 

In contrast to past preview versions of WinUI 3, you'll download a Project Reunion VSIX package instead of a WinUI VSIX package. The Project Reunion VSIX includes [WinUI Project Templates](../winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md) that you'll use to build your WinUI 3 app. Once you've completed your installation, the experience of developing a WinUI 3 app should not change.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also clone and build the WinUI 3 Preview version of the [XAML Controls Gallery](#xaml-controls-gallery-winui-3-preview-branch).

> [!NOTE]
> To use WinUI 3 tooling such as Live Visual Tree, Hot Reload, and Live Property Explorer, you must enable WinUI 3 tooling with Visual Studio Preview Features as described in the [instructions here](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/4140).

Once you've set up your development environment, see [Create WinUI 3 projects](../winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md) to familiarize yourself with the available Visual Studio Project and Item templates. 

For more information about getting started with the WinUI project templates, see the following articles:

- [Get started with WinUI 3 for desktop apps](../get-started-winui3-for-desktop.md)
- [Get started with WinUI 3 for UWP apps (Preview)](../get-started-winui3-for-uwp.md)

Aside from the [limitations and known issues](#limitations-and-known-issues), building an app using the WinUI projects is  similar to building a UWP app with XAML and WinUI 2.x. Therefore, most of the [guidance documentation](/windows/uwp/design/) for UWP apps and the **Windows.UI** WinRT namespaces in the Windows SDK is applicable.

WinUI 3 API reference documentation is available here: [WinUI 3 API Reference](/windows/winui/api)

If you created a project using WinUI 3 Preview 4, you can upgrade your project to use Project Reunion 0.5 Preview. See the [WinUI GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/winui3/upgrade-instructions) for detailed instructions.

### WebView2
To use WebView2 with this WinUI 3 preview, please download the Evergreen Bootstrapper or Evergreen Standalone Installer found on [this page](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) if you don't already have the WebView2 Runtime installed. 

### Windows Community Toolkit

If you're using the Windows Community Toolkit, [download the latest version](https://aka.ms/wct-winui3).

### Visual Studio Support

In order to take advantage of the latest tooling features added into WinUI 3 like Hot Reload, Live Visual Tree, and Live Property Explorer, you must use the latest **preview** version of Visual Studio with the latest WinUI 3 preview and be sure to enable WinUI tooling in Visual Studio Preview Features, as described in the [instructions here](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/4140). The table below shows the compatibility of future versions with WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview:

| VS Version  | WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview  |
|---|---|
| 16.8 RTM  | No   |
| 16.9 Previews  | Yes, with tooling  | 
| 16.9 RTM  | Yes, but no Hot Reload, Live Visual Tree, or Live Property Explorer   |
| 16.10 Previews  | Yes, with tooling   |

## Major changes introduced in this release

- WinUI 3 now ships as a part of the Project Reunion package, which will also be the mechanism for how our future supported releases will ship.

- In-app acrylic is now supported.

- The Pivot control is no longer supported, and has been deprecated in WinUI 3. We recommend using the [NavigationView control](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/navigationview) for your in-app navigation scenarios.

- WinUI 3 and Project Reunion will only be supported down-level to Windows 10 version 1809 - it requires build 17763 or newer.

- Preview features are now marked as experimental. 
  - A preview feature is anything that will continue to be a part of WinUI 3 previews, but will not be a part of the next WinUI 3 supported release. 
  - Preview features also include any experimental APIs that are a part of the WinUI 2.6 preview.
  - When building an app that uses a preview feature, your app will throw a warning.

The following items are some of the known issues with WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview. If you find an issue that isn't listed below, please let us know by contributing to an existing issue or filing a new issue through the [WinUI GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/new/choose).

### Platform and OS support

WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview is compatible with PCs running the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809 - build 17763) and newer.

### Developer tools

- Only C# and C++/WinRT apps are supported

- IMEs do not work
- CoreWindow, ApplicationView, CoreApplicationView, CoreDispatcher and their dependencies are not supported in desktop apps (see below)

### CoreWindow, ApplicationView, CoreApplicationView, and CoreDispatcher in desktop apps

New in Preview 4 and standard going forward,
[CoreWindow](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow),
[ApplicationView](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView),
[CoreApplicationView](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplicationView)
[CoreDispatcher](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcher),
and their dependencies are not available in desktop apps. 
For example the
[Window.Dispatcher](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Window.Dispatcher)
property is always null, but the Window.DispatcherQueue property can be used as an alternative.

These APIs only work in UWP apps. In past previews they've partially worked in desktop apps as well, but in Preview4 they've been fully disabled. These APIs are designed for the UWP case where there is only one window per thread,
and one of the features of WinUI3 is to enable multiple.

There are APIs that internally depend on existence of these APIs, which consequently aren't supported in a desktop app. These APIs generally have a static `GetForCurrentView` method. For example [UIViewSettings.GetForCurrentView](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.UIViewSettings.GetForCurrentView).

For more information on affected APIs as well as workarounds and replacements for these APIs, please see [WinRT API changes for desktop apps](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/winrt-apis-for-desktop.md)

### Known issues

- There’s an issue that’s causing UWP apps to fail to launch on Windows 10 version 1809. The team is actively working on fixing this bug for the next preview release.

- Alt+F4 does not close desktop app windows.

- The [UISettings.ColorValuesChanged Event](/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.uisettings.colorvalueschanged) and [AccessibilitySettings.HighContrastChanged Event](/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.accessibilitysettings.highcontrastchanged) are no longer supported in desktop apps. This may cause issues if you are using it to detect changes in Windows themes. 

- This release includes some experimental APIs, which will throw build warnings when used. These have not been thoroughly tested by the team and may have unknown issues. Please [file a bug](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) on our repo if you encounter any issues. 

- Previously, to get a CompositionCapabilities instance you would call [CompositionCapabilites.GetForCurrentView()](/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition.compositioncapabilities.getforcurrentview). However, the capabilities returned from this call were *not* dependent on the view. To address and reflect this, we've deleted the GetForCurrentView() static in this release, so now you can create a [CompositionCapabilties](/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition.compositioncapabilities) object directly.

- For C# UWP apps:

  The WinUI 3 framework is a set of WinRT components which can be used from C++ (using C++/WinRT) or C#. When using C#, there are two versions of .NET, depending on the app model: when using WinUI 3 in a UWP app you’re using .NET Native; when using in a desktop app you’re using .NET 5 (and C#/WinRT).

  When using C# for a WinUI 3 app in UWP, there are a few API namespace differences compared to C# in a WinUI 3 desktop app or a C# WinUI 2 app: some types are in a `Microsoft` namespace rather than a `System` namespace. For example, rather than the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface being in the `System.ComponentModel`  namespace, it’s in the `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Data` namespace. 

  This applies to:
    - `INotifyPropertyChanged` (and related types)
    - `INotifyCollectionChanged`
    - `ICommand`

  The `System` namespace versions still exist, but cannot be used with WinUI 3. This means that `ObservableCollection` doesn't work as-is in WinUI 3 C# UWP apps. For a workaround, see the [CollectionsInterop sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/blob/winui3preview/XamlControlsGallery/CollectionsInterop.cs) in the [XAML Controls Gallery sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview).

## XAML Controls Gallery (WinUI 3 Preview branch)

See the [WinUI 3 Preview branch of the XAML Controls Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for a sample app that includes all controls and features that are a part of the WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview.
