# Build desktop apps for Windows PCs

This article provides the info you need to get started building desktop apps for Windows or updating existing desktop apps to adopt the latest experiences in Windows 10.

## Platforms for desktop apps

There are four main platforms for building desktop apps for Windows PCs. Each platform provides an app model that defines the lifecycle of the app, a complete UI framework and set of UI controls that let you create desktop apps like Word, Excel, and Photoshop, and access to a comprehensive set of managed or native APIs for using Windows features. For an in-depth comparison of these platforms along with additional resources for each platform, see [Choose your app platform](choose-your-platform.md).

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows 10, each these platforms also support using the Windows UI (WinUI) Library to create user interfaces. For more information about WinUI for desktop apps, see [this section](choose-your-platform.md#windows-ui-library).

## Update existing desktop apps for Windows 10

If you have an existing WPF, Windows Forms, or native Win32 desktop app, Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) offer many features you can use to deliver a modern experience in your app. Most of these features are available as modular components that you can adopt in your app at your own pace without having to rewrite your app for a different platform.

Here are just a few of the features available to enhance your existing desktop apps:

* Use [MSIX](/windows/msix/) to package and deploy your desktop apps. MSIX is a modern Windows app package format that provides a universal packaging experience for all Windows apps. MSIX brings together the best aspects of MSI, .appx, App-V and ClickOnce installation technologies and is built to be safe, secure, and reliable.
* Integrate your desktop app with Windows 10 experiences by using [package extensions](./modernize/desktop-to-uwp-extensions.md). For example, point Start tiles to your app, make your app a share target, or send toast notifications from your app.
* Use [XAML Islands](./modernize/xaml-islands.md) to host UWP XAML controls in your desktop app. Many of the latest Windows 10 UI features are only available to UWP XAML controls.
