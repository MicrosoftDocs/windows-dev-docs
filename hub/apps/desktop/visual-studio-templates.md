# Visual Studio project and item templates for Windows apps

Visual Studio 2019 provides many project and item templates that help you build apps for Windows 10 devices by using C\# or C++. This topic describes the templates and helps you choose one for your scenario.

* Project templates include project files, code files, and other assets that are configured to build an app or a component that can be loaded and used by an app.
* Item templates are project files that contain commonly used code and XAML that can be added to a project to reduce development time. For example, you can use an item template to add a new window, page, or control to your app.

## WinUI templates

The [Windows UI Library (WinUI)](../winui/index.md) is the modern native user interface (UI) platform for Windows apps across desktop (.NET and native Win32) and UWP app platforms. [WinUI 3](../winui/winui3/index.md) (currently available as a developer preview) is the latest major version of WinUI, and it transforms WinUI into a full UX framework for desktop Windows apps.

WinUI 3 includes a VSIX package for Visual Studio 2019 that provides project and item templates that help you get started building apps with a WinUI-based interface. For more information about the WinUI 3 VSIX package and the project templates that it provides, see [this section](../winui/winui3/index.md#install-winui-3-preview-2).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WinUI 3, including the related Visual Studio templates, are currently available as a developer preview that is intended for early evaluation and to gather feedback from the developer community. It should NOT be used for production apps at this time.

## UWP templates

Visual Studio provides a variety of project templates for building UWP apps with C# or C++. To use these project templates, you must include the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload when you install Visual Studio. For the C++ project templates, you must also include the **C++ (v142) Universal Windows Platforms tools** optional component for the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload.

### Project templates for C# and UWP

To access the UWP C# project templates when you create a new project in Visual Studio, filter the language to **C#**, the platform to **Windows**, and the project type to **UWP**.

![UWP C# project templates](images/uwp-projects-csharp.png)

You can use these project templates to create C# UWP apps.

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Blank App (Universal Windows) | Creates a UWP app. The generated project includes a basic page that derives from the [Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.page) class that you can use to start building your UI. |
| Unit Test App (Universal Windows) | Creates a unit test project in C# for a UWP app. For more information, see [Unit test C# code](/visualstudio/test/unit-testing-visual-csharp-code-in-a-store-app). |

You can use these project templates to build pieces of a C# UWP app.

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Class Library (Universal Windows) | Creates a managed class library (DLL) in C# that can be used by other UWP apps written in managed code. |
| Windows Runtime Component (Universal Windows) | Creates a [Windows Runtime component](/windows/uwp/winrt-components/) in C# that can be consumed by any UWP app, regardless of the programming language in which the app is written. |
| Optional Code Package (Universal Windows) | Creates an optional package with executable C# code that can be loaded by an app. For more information, see [Optional packages with executable code](/windows/msix/package/optional-packages-with-executable-code).  |

### Project templates for C++ and UWP

There are two different technologies you can use to build C++ UWP apps:

* The recommended technology is [C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/). This is a C++ language projection that is implemented entirely in header files, and designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern WinRT API.
* Alternatively, you can use the older [C++/CX](/cpp/cppcx/visual-c-language-reference-c-cx) set of extensions. C++/CX is still supported, but we recommend that you use C++/WinRT instead.

To access the UWP C++ project templates when you create a new project in Visual Studio, filter the language to **C++**, the platform to **Windows**, and the project type to **UWP**. 

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload in Visual Studio only provides access to the C++/CX project templates. To access the C++/WinRT project templates, you must install the [C++/WinRT VSIX](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt#visual-studio-support-for-cwinrt-xaml-the-vsix-extension-and-the-nuget-package) package.

You can use these project templates to create C++ UWP apps.

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Blank App (C++/WinRT) | Creates a C++/WinRT UWP app with a XAML user interface. The generated project includes a basic page that derives from the [Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.page) class that you can use to start building your UI. |
| Core App (C++/WinRT) | Creates a C++/WinRT UWP app that uses [CoreApplication](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication) to integrate with a variety of UI frameworks instead of a XAML user interface. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to use this project template to create a simple game that uses DirectX, see [Create a simple UWP game with DirectX](/windows/uwp/gaming/tutorial--create-your-first-uwp-directx-game). |
| Blank App (Universal Windows - C++/CX) | Creates a C++/WinRT UWP app with a XAML user interface. The generated project includes a basic page that derives from the [Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.page) class in the WinUI library that you can use to start building your UI. |
| DirectX 11 and XAML App (Universal Windows - C++/CX) | Creates a UWP app that uses DirectX 11 and a **SwapChainPanel** so you can use XAML UI controls. For more information, see [DirectX game project templates](/windows/uwp/gaming/user-interface). |
| DirectX 11 App (Universal Windows - C++/CX) | Creates a UWP app that uses DirectX 11. For more information, see [DirectX game project templates](/windows/uwp/gaming/user-interface). |

| DLL (Universal Windows) | A project for creating a dynamic-link library (DLL) in C++/CX that can be used in a UWP app. For more information, see [DLLs (C++/CX)](/cpp/cppcx/dlls-c-cx). |
| Static Library (Universal Windows) | A project for creating a static library (LIB) in C++/CX that can be used in a UWP app. For more information, see [Static libraries (C++/CX)](/cpp/cppcx/static-libraries-c-cx). |

## C++/Win32 templates

Visual Studio provides a variety of project templates for building desktop Windows apps with native C++ and direct access to the Win32 API. To use these project templates, you must include the **Desktop development with C++** workload when you install Visual Studio. This workload includes project templates for building desktop apps, console apps, and libraries.

### Project templates for desktop apps
