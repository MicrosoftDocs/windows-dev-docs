# Windows App Development CLI (winapp CLI)

The Windows App Development CLI (winapp CLI) is a single command-line interface for managing Windows SDKs, packaging, generating app identity, manifests, certificates, and using build tools with any app framework. This tool bridges the gap between cross-platform development and Windows-native capabilities.

Whether you're building with .NET/Win32, CMake, Electron, or Rust, this CLI gives you access to:

- **Modern Windows APIs** - [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/) and Windows SDK with automatic setup and code generation
- **Package Identity** - Debug and test by adding package identity without full packaging
- **MSIX Packaging** - App packaging with signing and Store readiness
- **Developer Tools** - Manifests, certificates, assets, and build integration

## Why package identity?

Many powerful Windows APIs require your app to have package identity. With identity, your app gains access to features like advanced OS integration and on-device AI. For a full list of what package identity unlocks and help choosing the right packaging model, see [Packaging overview](../../package-and-deploy/packaging/index.md).

## Installation

### WinGet

The easiest way to install the CLI is via WinGet (Windows Package Manager):

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.winappcli --source winget
```

### NPM

For Electron projects, install via NPM:

```powershell
npm install @microsoft/winappcli --save-dev
```

### GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps

For CI/CD pipelines, use the [`setup-WinAppCli`](https://github.com/microsoft/setup-WinAppCli) action to automatically install the CLI on your runners/agents.

### Manual download

Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/releases/latest).

## Verify installation

Once installed, verify the installation by calling the CLI:

```bash
winapp --help
```

Or if using Electron/Node.js:

```bash
npx winapp --help
```
