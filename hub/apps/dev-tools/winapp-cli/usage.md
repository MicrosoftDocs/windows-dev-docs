# CLI Documentation and Usage

## Shell Completion

Enable tab completion for commands, options, and values. See the [Shell Completion guide](guides/shell-completion.md) for setup instructions.

```powershell
# Quick setup for PowerShell (permanent — add to profile)
winapp complete --setup powershell >> $PROFILE

# Or try it in the current session only
winapp complete --setup powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

### init

Initialize a directory with Windows SDK, Windows App SDK, and required assets for modern Windows development.

```bash
winapp init [base-directory] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `base-directory` - Base/root directory for the app/workspace (default: current directory)

**Options:**

- `--config-dir <path>` - Directory to read/store configuration (default: the selected project directory, or current directory if no project is detected)
- `--setup-sdks` - SDK installation mode: 'stable' (default), 'preview', 'experimental', or 'none' (skip SDK installation)
- `--ignore-config`, `--no-config` - Don't use configuration file for version management
- `--no-gitignore` - Don't update .gitignore file
- `--use-defaults`, `--no-prompt` - Do not prompt, and use default of all prompts
- `--config-only` - Only handle configuration file operations, skip package installation
- `--exe <path>` - Path to the application executable. **Requires `--sparse`.** Generates an identity-only sparse manifest for the exe instead of a full package/SDK setup.
- `--sparse` - Generate a sparse identity manifest (`appxmanifest.xml`) for an existing desktop exe. Skips SDK/package installation. Use with `--exe`.
- `--name <name>` - Override the package name (sparse only; default: inferred from the exe)
- `--publisher <CN>` - Override the publisher CN (sparse only; default: inferred from the exe's company name)
- `--output-dir <path>` - Directory to write the sparse manifest and `Assets/` (sparse only; default: a `sparse/` folder in the current directory)
- `--force` - Overwrite an existing `appxmanifest.xml` in the target directory (sparse only). Without it, init fails instead of replacing an existing manifest/assets.
- `--add-js-bindings` *(npm only)* - Add `winapp.jsBindings` to package.json and generate JS/TypeScript bindings, without prompting (incompatible with `--setup-sdks none`)

**What it does:**

- Creates `winapp.yaml` configuration file (only when SDK packages are managed; skipped with `--setup-sdks none`)
- Downloads Windows SDK and Windows App SDK packages
- Generates C++/WinRT headers and binaries
- Creates Package.appxmanifest
- Sets up build tools and enables developer mode
- Updates .gitignore to exclude generated files
- Stores shareable files in the global cache directory
- Generates JS bindings for Windows App SDK APIs when enabled (npm only)

**Automatic project detection:**

When `init` is run without a directory argument, it performs a breadth-first search of the current directory tree to find compatible projects (up to 10). Supported project types:

- **Tauri** — `tauri.conf.json` found one level below the directory
- **Electron** — `package.json` with `electron` in dependencies or devDependencies
- **Flutter** — `pubspec.yaml` at project root
- **.NET** — `.csproj` at project root
- **Rust** — `Cargo.toml` at project root
- **C++** — `CMakeLists.txt` at project root

The search skips commonly ignored directories (node_modules, bin, obj, .git, etc.). When a compatible project is found, subdirectories below it are not searched.

- If a directory argument is provided (e.g., `winapp init .` or `winapp init path/to/project`), the search is skipped and `init` checks only that directory for a compatible project
- If `--use-defaults` (or `--no-prompt`) is set without a directory argument, `init` skips the search and initializes the current directory non-interactively, warning first if no known project type is detected there (e.g., `winapp init --use-defaults`)
- In non-interactive environments (piped stdin, CI, redirected input), `init` automatically uses `--use-defaults` behavior and emits a warning: `Non-interactive environment detected. Using default values.`
- If the current directory is a compatible project, `init` proceeds immediately
- If exactly one project is found elsewhere, you're prompted to confirm
- If multiple projects are found, you can select which one to initialize — the current directory is always available as a fallback option
- If no projects are found, you're warned and asked whether to proceed anyway
- If the search reaches the 10-project limit, a warning suggests providing a directory argument

**Automatic .NET project flow:**

When a `.csproj` file is found in the target directory, `init` uses a streamlined .NET-specific flow:

- Validates and updates the `TargetFramework` to a Windows-compatible TFM (e.g., `net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`)
- Adds `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` and `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools` as NuGet `PackageReference` entries directly in the `.csproj`
- Generates `Package.appxmanifest`, assets, and a development certificate
- Does **not** create a `winapp.yaml` or download C++ projections (use `dotnet restore` for NuGet packages)

**Sparse identity mode (`--exe` + `--sparse`):**

Generates an identity-only [sparse package](guides/sparse.md) manifest for an existing desktop executable — the first step of the [sparse packaging workflow](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/grant-identity-to-nonpackaged-apps). Unlike the full `init` flow, this **skips all SDK/package installation** (sparse identity packages have no SDK dependencies) and only generates a manifest and placeholder assets.

- Infers the package name, publisher, description, and version from the exe via `FileVersionInfo` (override with `--name`, `--publisher`, or interactively)
- Writes `appxmanifest.xml` (with the exe name substituted into `Executable`) plus an `Assets/` folder to a `sparse/` folder in the current directory (or `--output-dir`)
- Uses `--use-defaults`/`--no-prompt` to skip the interactive override prompts (CI-friendly)
- `--exe` without `--sparse` is an error

> **Assets are external.** The sparse `.msix` is identity-only: the generated `Assets/` are resolved from the app's install directory (the external content location) at runtime, **not** bundled into the `.msix`. Deploy them alongside your application.

Next steps after `winapp init --exe <exe> --sparse`: [`winapp pack <appxmanifest.xml>`](#pack) to build the identity `.msix`, then [`winapp embed-identity <exe>`](#embed-identity). See the [Sparse Packaging Guide](guides/sparse.md) for the full walkthrough.


**Examples:**

```bash
# Initialize current directory
winapp init

# Initialize with experimental packages
winapp init --setup-sdks experimental

# Initialize specific directory without prompts
winapp init ./my-project --use-defaults

# Initialize a .NET project (auto-detected from .csproj)
cd my-dotnet-app
winapp init

# Generate a sparse identity manifest for an existing exe (no SDK install)
winapp init --exe ./bin/Release/net8.0-windows/MyApp.exe --sparse --use-defaults
```

**Tip: Install SDKs after initial setup**

If you ran `init` with `--setup-sdks none` (or skipped SDK installation) and later need the SDKs:

```bash
# Re-run init to install SDKs - preserves existing files (manifest, etc.)
winapp init . --use-defaults --setup-sdks stable
```

Use `--setup-sdks preview` or `--setup-sdks experimental` for preview/experimental SDK versions.

---

### new

Create a new **WinUI** app from an official Windows App SDK `dotnet new` template. Interactive by default; automatically uses defaults in non-interactive environments.

```bash
winapp new [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-t, --template <short-name>` - Template short name (e.g. `winui`, `winui-navview`, `winui-mvvm`, `winui-lib`, `winui-unittest`, or an experimental Reactor template such as `reactor` or `reactor-mvu`). Validated against the installed pack at run time; run `winapp new --list` to see all. Default: `winui` (blank XAML app).
- `-n, --name <name>` - Name for the new app/project (default: derived from `--output`, else `WinUIApp`)
- `-o, --output <path>` - Directory to create the app in (default: `./<name>`)
- `--use-defaults`, `--no-prompt` - Do not prompt; use defaults (blank template, name from `--output`/`--name`, and keep the installed template pack rather than updating it)
- `--force` - Scaffold even if the output directory already contains files
- `--template-version <latest|installed|version>` - WinUI template pack version: `latest` installs the newest published pack, `installed` keeps whatever is already downloaded (no network), or pin an explicit version such as `1.2.3`. Default: install the latest when no pack is present, otherwise prompt to update a stale pack (kept as-is under `--use-defaults`).
- `--list` - List the available WinUI templates and exit (installs the latest pack first if none is installed)
- `--json` - Format output as JSON

**Templates:**

The pack ships two styles of WinUI app. **XAML** templates define the UI in markup with a C# code-behind. **Reactor** templates are pure C# with no XAML, using an MVU (Model-View-Update) pattern. The template list is read live from the installed pack, so it always reflects the version you have — run `winapp new --list` to see the current set. Common templates:

| Short name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `winui` | Minimal blank XAML app (MSIX packaging) |
| `winui-navview` | XAML NavigationView starter app |
| `winui-tabview` | XAML TabView starter app |
| `winui-mvvm` | XAML MVVM app (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm) |
| `winui-lib` | WinUI 3 class library |
| `winui-unittest` | Packaged MSTest app; tests run when it's launched |
| `reactor` | **Experimental.** Blank Reactor app — pure C#, no XAML |
| `reactor-mvu` | **Experimental.** Reactor app demonstrating the MVU pattern |
| `reactor-navview` | **Experimental.** Reactor NavigationView starter app |
| `reactor-tabview` | **Experimental.** Reactor TabView starter app |

> **Reactor templates are experimental.** They reference the prerelease `Microsoft.UI.Reactor` packages, whose APIs can change or be removed in a future release. `winapp new` marks them **(Experimental)** in `--list` and in the interactive picker, sets `"Experimental": true` in `--json`, and prints a warning after scaffolding one. They are never chosen as the default template. Reactor also requires the **.NET 10 SDK or newer**; on an older SDK `winapp new` fails up front with the version it needs rather than scaffolding a project you can't build.

Each template's canonical short name is the first alias `dotnet new` lists for it; any listed alias (e.g. `winui3`, `wasdk-single`, `winui-reactor`) is also accepted. When run inside an existing WinUI project, `dotnet new` also surfaces **item** templates (e.g. a blank page), which `winapp new` adds into the current project rather than creating a new one.

**Template pack versioning:**

`winapp new` no longer pins a specific template pack version. If no pack is installed it installs the **latest**. If an older pack is already installed it checks the feed and, when a newer one exists, **prompts** whether to update — except in non-interactive/`--use-defaults` runs, which keep the installed pack. Use `--template-version latest` to always take the newest without prompting, or `--template-version installed` to always use the downloaded pack without a network check. Passing an **explicit** version (e.g. `--template-version 1.2.3`) always installs exactly that version — reinstalling even when a newer pack is already present — so scaffolding is reproducible across machines.

> **A first run may take longer:** Installing or updating the template pack, or restoring missing Windows App SDK NuGet packages used by the selected template, can require additional downloads. This can also happen after a new Windows App SDK version is published. If scaffolding is still running after 10 seconds, `winapp new` updates its status message to indicate that packages may be downloading or restoring.

**What it does:**

- Verifies the .NET SDK is installed (fails fast with guidance if missing — `winapp` does not install toolchains)
- Installs or updates the official WinUI template pack (`Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.WinUI.CSharp.Templates`) on demand
- Enumerates the available templates from the installed pack and delegates scaffolding to `dotnet new <short-name>`

WinUI app templates already include Windows packaging and identity (`Package.appxmanifest`), so no separate `winapp init` step is required. For app templates, use `winapp run` to build and launch the app. The `winui-lib` template produces a class library to reference from an app project (it has no app manifest). The `winui-unittest` template is a **packaged MSTest app whose tests run when the app is launched** (`winapp run`) — not via `dotnet test`. `winapp new` scaffolds against your installed .NET SDK's target framework and prints the appropriate next step for the template you choose.

Pass the global `--verbose` (`-v`) flag to echo every underlying `dotnet` invocation (pack query, update check, install, `dotnet new list`, scaffold) along with its full output — useful for diagnosing template-pack or scaffolding issues.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive: pick a template, then a name (output defaults to ./<name>)
winapp new

# List the available templates without scaffolding
winapp new --list

# One-shot with a specific template
winapp new --name MyApp --template winui-navview

# Experimental Reactor app (pure C#, no XAML) — requires the .NET 10 SDK
winapp new --name MyApp --template reactor-mvu

# Always use the newest template pack, no prompts
winapp new --name MyApp --template-version latest --use-defaults

# Show the underlying dotnet commands and their output
winapp new --name MyApp --verbose

# Non-interactive (agent) with machine-readable output
winapp new --use-defaults --name MyApp --json
```

---

### restore

Restore packages and regenerate files based on existing `winapp.yaml` configuration.

```bash
winapp restore [base-directory] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `base-directory` - Directory to restore (default: current directory). Also selects where `winapp.yaml` and `nuget.config` are read from unless `--config-dir` overrides it.

**Options:**

- `--config-dir <path>` - Directory containing winapp.yaml (default: base-directory)

**What it does:**

- Reads existing `winapp.yaml` configuration
- Downloads/updates SDK packages to specified versions
- Regenerates C++/WinRT headers and binaries
- Stores shareable files in the global cache directory

> [!NOTE]
> For .NET projects there is no `winapp.yaml` — the SDK versions live as `PackageReference` entries in the `.csproj` — so `winapp restore` runs `dotnet restore` for you.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Restore from winapp.yaml in current directory
winapp restore

# Restore a specific project directory (reads ./my-project/winapp.yaml)
winapp restore ./my-project
```

**Custom and private NuGet feeds:**

`winapp init`, `restore`, and `update` download the Windows SDK and Windows App SDK packages through NuGet, honoring your standard [`nuget.config`](/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file) hierarchy. Private feeds and mirrors, feed credentials (including credential providers), and a custom `globalPackagesFolder` all work as they do for `dotnet restore`. To restore exclusively from your own mirror, `<clear />` the inherited sources and add just yours:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="contoso" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/contoso/_packaging/winsdk-mirror/nuget/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

> [!NOTE]
> For native projects winapp resolves `nuget.config` from the directory it operates on: the `init`/`restore` directory argument, `--config-dir` when given, otherwise the current directory. For **.NET projects** the sources come from the project's own `nuget.config` hierarchy instead, because that is what `dotnet add package` and `dotnet restore` use, so put a private feed's config in the project directory or an ancestor. A `--config-dir` outside that hierarchy is reported and ignored rather than silently selecting versions the project cannot restore. Run these commands only against directories you trust, the same caution that applies to `dotnet restore`. When several sources are configured, use [Package Source Mapping](/nuget/consume-packages/package-source-mapping) to pin each package to a feed.

---

### update

Update packages to their latest versions and update the configuration file.

```bash
winapp update [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--setup-sdks <stable|preview|experimental|none>` - SDK installation mode: `stable` (default), `preview`, `experimental`, or `none` (skip SDK installation)

**What it does:**

- Reads existing `winapp.yaml` configuration in the current directory
- Updates all packages to their latest available versions
- Updates the `winapp.yaml` file with new version numbers
- Regenerates C++/WinRT headers and binaries

**Examples:**

```bash
# Update packages to latest versions
winapp update

# Update including experimental packages
winapp update --setup-sdks experimental
```

---

### pack

Create MSIX packages from a project or prepared application directories. Requires a manifest file (`Package.appxmanifest` preferred, `appxmanifest.xml` also supported) to be present in the target directory, in the current directory, or passed with the `--manifest` option. (run `init` or `manifest generate` to create a manifest)

Pass a single `.csproj` to build the project and package its output in one step (**project mode**, see [Packaging a project directly](#packaging-a-project-directly) below). Pass multiple input folders to create an `.msixbundle` for multi-architecture distribution (see [Multi-architecture bundles](#multi-architecture-bundles) below).

```bash
winapp pack <input-folder> [input-folder...] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `input-folder` - A single `.csproj` to build and package (project mode), or one or more directories containing the application files to package. Pass multiple folders (e.g., `./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64`) to create an MSIX bundle. For **sparse identity packages**, pass a sparse `appxmanifest.xml` file directly instead of a folder (see [Sparse identity packages](#sparse-identity-packages) below).

**Options:**

- `--output <filename>` - Output file name. For single packages: `<name>_<version>_<arch>.msix` (falling back to `<name>_<version>.msix`, `<name>_<arch>.msix`, or `<name>.msix`). For bundles: `<name>_<version>_<arch1>_<arch2>.msixbundle`.
- `--name <name>` - Package name (default: from manifest)
- `--manifest <path>` - Path to manifest file (`Package.appxmanifest` preferred, `appxmanifest.xml` also supported; default: auto-detect)
- `--cert <path>` - Path to signing certificate (enables auto-signing)
- `--cert-password <password>` - Certificate password (default: "password")
- `--generate-cert` - Generate a new development certificate
- `--no-sign` - Deliver the package unsigned, overriding any project signing configuration (e.g. for Store submission or an external signing pipeline). Cannot be combined with `--cert` or `--generate-cert`.
- `--install-cert` - Install certificate to machine
- `--publisher <name>` - Publisher for certificate generation. Accepts a full X.500 distinguished name or a bare name (automatically wrapped as `CN=<name>`)
- `--self-contained` - Bundle Windows App SDK runtime
- `--skip-pri` - Skip PRI file generation
- `--executable <path>` - Path to the executable relative to the input folder (also `--exe`). Used to resolve `$targetnametoken$` placeholders in the manifest.

**Project-mode options** (require a `.csproj` input; rejected for folder/bundle/manifest inputs):

- `--configuration <name>` (`-c`) - Build configuration (default: `Release`)
- `--arch <arch>` - Target architecture: `x64`, `arm64`, or `x86` (default: the current process architecture)
- `--framework <tfm>` (`-f`) - Target framework moniker for multi-targeted projects
- `--no-build` - Package the existing build output without rebuilding
- `--no-restore` - Skip restoring the project before building
- `--property <name=value>` (`-p`) - MSBuild property, forwarded to build and evaluation (repeatable)

> **Note:** For a WinUI / `EnableMsixTooling` `.csproj` (MSIX-tooling project mode), the Windows App SDK owns the manifest, the entry point, and PRI generation, so `--manifest`, `--executable`, and `--skip-pri` are rejected — configure `<AppxManifest>`, the project's entry point, and its resource build in the project itself. Those three options still apply to folder inputs and to generic (non-MSIX-tooling) `.csproj` project mode.

**What it does:**

- Validates and processes Package.appxmanifest files
- Resolves `$placeholder$` tokens in the manifest (see [Manifest placeholders](#manifest-placeholders) below)
- Ensures proper framework dependencies
- Updates side-by-side manifests with registrations
- Automatically discovers and bundles any non-image files referenced in the manifest (e.g., AppExtension `manifest.json`, config files) from the manifest directory or input folder if they are missing from staging
- Automatically discovers third-party WinRT components and registers their activatable classes (see [WinRT component discovery](#winrt-component-discovery) below)
- Handles self-contained WinAppSDK deployment
- Signs package if certificate provided

#### Packaging a project directly

When the input is a single `.csproj`, `winapp pack` builds the project (using the options above) and packages the resulting output — no need to build separately or locate the output folder first. This mirrors `winapp run`'s project mode.

```bash
# Build MyApp in Release for arm64 and package + sign it in one step
winapp pack ./MyApp.csproj -c Release --arch arm64 --cert ./devcert.pfx

# Package an existing build output without rebuilding
winapp pack ./MyApp.csproj --no-build

# Select the target architecture with an exact RID instead of --arch
winapp pack ./MyApp.csproj -p RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64
```

The target architecture comes from `--arch`, or from a lone `-p RuntimeIdentifier=<rid>` when you don't pass `--arch` (the exact RID is preserved and drives the build). Passing both `--arch` and `-p RuntimeIdentifier` is a conflict and is rejected.

The project must build as a packaged app (`EnableMsixTooling=true` with a `Package.appxmanifest`); a project that builds as an unpackaged app (`WindowsPackageType=None`) has no MSIX manifest to package and `winapp pack` reports an actionable error. Folder, bundle, and sparse-manifest inputs are unchanged.

Project mode produces a single `.msix` or an architecture-only `.msixbundle` (see [Multi-architecture bundles](#multi-architecture-bundles)). It does not produce Store-upload archives or resource-split (language/scale) bundles: an explicit `-p UapAppxPackageBuildMode=StoreUpload` or `-p AppxBundleAutoResourcePackageQualifiers=...` is rejected with a note to run the native SDK packaging command directly for those flows.

#### Sparse identity packages

When the input is a **sparse `appxmanifest.xml` file** (one declaring `<uap10:AllowExternalContent>true</uap10:AllowExternalContent>` under `<Properties>`) rather than a folder, `winapp pack` builds an **identity-only** `.msix` — it packages just the manifest, with no application binaries or assets. This is step 2 of the [sparse packaging workflow](guides/sparse.md).

```bash
# Build a signed identity package from a sparse manifest
winapp pack ./sparse/appxmanifest.xml --cert ./devcert.pfx
```

- Output defaults to `<PackageName>.identity.msix` in the current directory (override with `--output`).
- Signing happens only when `--cert` (or `--generate-cert`) is provided.
- If you instead pass a **folder** whose manifest declares `AllowExternalContent`, the existing folder-packaging behavior applies, but `winapp pack` warns if it finds assets (`.png`/`.jpg`/`.ico`) or binaries (`.exe`/`.dll`/`.so`) — for sparse packages these belong at the external location, not inside the `.msix`.

After packing, run [`winapp embed-identity <exe>`](#embed-identity) and register the package in your installer with `Add-AppxPackage -Path <msix> -ExternalLocation <install-dir>`. See the [Sparse Packaging Guide](guides/sparse.md).


#### WinRT component discovery

When packaging, `winapp pack` automatically scans NuGet packages defined in the `winapp.yaml` or `*.csproj` for third-party WinRT components (e.g., Win2D). It parses `.winmd` files to extract activatable class names and locates their implementation DLLs. The discovered entries are registered as follows:

- **Framework-dependent** (default): Activatable classes are added as `<InProcessServer>` entries in the `Package.appxmanifest`
- **Self-contained** (`--self-contained`): Activatable classes are embedded in side-by-side (SxS) manifests within the executable

**Placeholder resolution during packaging:**

If the manifest contains `$targetnametoken$` in the `Executable` attribute:
1. If `--executable` is provided (path relative to the input folder), the placeholder is replaced with the specified value
2. Otherwise, `winapp pack` scans the input folder root for `.exe` files — if exactly one is found, it is used automatically
3. If zero or multiple `.exe` files are found, an error is shown asking you to specify `--executable`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Package directory with auto-detected manifest
winapp pack ./dist

# Package with custom output name and certificate
winapp pack ./dist --output MyApp.msix --cert ./cert.pfx

# Package with generated and installed certificate and self-contained WinAppSDK runtime
winapp pack ./dist --generate-cert --install-cert --self-contained

# Package with explicit executable (resolves $targetnametoken$ in manifest)
winapp pack ./dist --executable MyApp.exe
```

#### Multi-architecture bundles

When multiple input folders are passed, `winapp pack` creates an `.msixbundle` containing one `.msix` per architecture:

```bash
# Create unsigned bundle for Microsoft Store submission
winapp pack ./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64

# Create signed bundle for sideloading
winapp pack ./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64 --cert ./devcert.pfx

# Self-contained bundle
winapp pack ./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64 --self-contained --generate-cert
```

The command auto-detects each folder's architecture from the primary executable's PE header, validates consistency across slices (Identity, Capabilities, Dependencies), and produces a `<Name>_<Version>_<arch1>_<arch2>.msixbundle`.

**Manifest resolution for bundles:**

Each slice in the bundle needs a manifest. The command resolves manifests in this order:

1. **`--manifest <path>`** — If specified, this single manifest is used for all slices. The `ProcessorArchitecture` is automatically updated per-slice to match the detected architecture.

2. **Per-folder manifest** — If each input folder contains a `Package.appxmanifest` (or `appxmanifest.xml`), that folder's manifest is used for its slice.

3. **Current directory fallback** — If a folder has no manifest, the command looks for `Package.appxmanifest` in the current working directory and uses it (with architecture auto-stamped).

In all cases, the manifest is automatically updated: placeholders are resolved, dependencies are injected, and the `ProcessorArchitecture` is force-set to the detected architecture. After resolution, a cross-slice validation ensures that Identity (Name, Version, Publisher), Capabilities, and Dependencies are consistent across all slices — only `ProcessorArchitecture` may differ.
The package version defined in the slices is atributed to the MSIX bundle version, except if it's `0.0.0.0`, in which case a timestamp-based version is automatically generated.

```bash
# Option 1: Single shared manifest (simplest for most projects)
# Place Package.appxmanifest in your project root and run from there
winapp pack ./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64

# Option 2: Explicit manifest path
winapp pack ./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64 --manifest ./src/Package.appxmanifest

# Option 3: Per-folder manifests (useful if slices have different app extensions)
# Each folder already contains its own Package.appxmanifest
winapp pack ./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64
```

### create-debug-identity

Create app identity for debugging using [sparse packaging](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/grant-identity-to-nonpackaged-apps). The exe stays in its original location — Windows associates identity with it via `Add-AppxPackage -ExternalLocation`.

> **When to use this vs `winapp run`:** Use `create-debug-identity` when the exe is **separate from your app code** (e.g., Electron apps where `electron.exe` is in `node_modules`), or when specifically testing sparse package behavior. For most frameworks where the exe is in your build output folder, use [`winapp run`](#run) instead — it registers a full loose layout package and launches the app. See the [Debugging Guide](debugging.md) for a full comparison.

```bash
winapp create-debug-identity [entrypoint] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `entrypoint` - Path to executable (.exe) or script that needs identity

**Options:**

- `--manifest <path>` - Path to the app manifest file, either `Package.appxmanifest` or `appxmanifest.xml` (default: auto-detect `Package.appxmanifest` or `appxmanifest.xml` in the current directory)
- `--no-install` - Don't install the package after creation
- `--keep-identity` - Keep the manifest identity as-is, without appending `.debug` to the package name and application ID

**What it does:**

- Modifies executable's side-by-side manifest
- Registers sparse package for identity
- Enables debugging of identity-requiring APIs

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add identity to executable using local manifest
winapp create-debug-identity ./bin/MyApp.exe

# Add identity with custom manifest location
winapp create-debug-identity ./dist/app.exe --manifest ./custom-manifest.xml

# Create identity for hosted app script
winapp create-debug-identity app.py
```

---

### embed-identity

Connect a desktop application to its **sparse identity package** by embedding the `<msix>` element into the app's side-by-side (fusion) manifest. This is step 3 of the [sparse packaging workflow](guides/sparse.md) — it tells Windows which identity package the running exe belongs to.

```bash
winapp embed-identity <target> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `target` - The file to update. Auto-detected by extension:
  - **`.exe`** (EXE mode) — embeds the `<msix>` element directly into the exe's side-by-side manifest using `mt.exe`.
  - **`.xml` / `.manifest`** (XML mode) — inserts or replaces the `<msix>` element in an external SxS manifest file (created if it doesn't exist). Rebuild your app afterward so the updated manifest is embedded in the binary.

**Options:**

- `--manifest <path>` - Path to the sparse `appxmanifest.xml` to read identity (packageName, publisher, applicationId) from. When omitted, the command searches a `sparse/` folder beside the target first, then in the current directory, then the target's directory and the current directory, for `appxmanifest.xml`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# EXE mode — embed identity straight into the built exe
winapp embed-identity ./bin/Release/net8.0-windows/MyApp.exe

# XML mode — update a checked-in side-by-side manifest, then rebuild
winapp embed-identity ./app.manifest --manifest ./appxmanifest.xml
```

> This command is idempotent: re-running it replaces any existing `<msix>` element rather than duplicating it.

### manifest

Generate and manage Package.appxmanifest files.

#### manifest generate

Generate Package.appxmanifest from templates.

```bash
winapp manifest generate [directory] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `directory` - Directory to generate manifest in (default: current directory)

**Options:**

- `--package-name <name>` - Package name (default: folder name)
- `--publisher-name <name>` - Publisher distinguished name (default: CN=\<current user\>). Accepts an X.500 DN with single-valued, comma-separated components (multi-valued `+` RDNs and backslashes are not supported); bare names are auto-wrapped as CN=\<name\>.
- `--version <version>` - Version (default: "1.0.0.0")
- `--description <text>` - Description (default: "My Application")
- `--entrypoint <path>` - Entry point executable or script
- `--template <type>` - Template type: `packaged` (default) or `sparse`
- `--logo-path <path>` - Path to logo image file
- `--if-exists <Error|Overwrite|Skip>` - Behavior when the manifest file already exists at the target path (default: `Error`)

**Templates:**

- `packaged` - Standard packaged app manifest
- `sparse` - App manifest using [sparse/external location packaging](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/grant-identity-to-nonpackaged-apps)

#### Manifest placeholders

Generated manifests use `$placeholder$` tokens (dollar-sign delimited) that are resolved automatically at packaging time:

| Placeholder | Resolved to | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `$targetnametoken$` | Executable name without extension | `Executable="$targetnametoken$.exe"` &rarr; `Executable="MyApp.exe"` |
| `$targetentrypoint$` | `Windows.FullTrustApplication` | Always resolved automatically |

This follows the same convention used by Visual Studio project templates, so manifests are portable across tooling.

**How placeholders are resolved:**

- **`winapp pack`** — During packaging, `$targetnametoken$` is resolved using the `--executable` option or by auto-detecting the single `.exe` in the input folder. If multiple (or zero) `.exe` files are found and `--executable` is not specified, an error is shown.
- **`winapp create-debug-identity`** — When an entrypoint argument is provided, `$targetnametoken$` is resolved from it. Without an entrypoint, the executable placeholder must already be resolved in the manifest.
- **`winapp manifest generate --executable`** — When `--executable` is provided, manifest metadata (version, description) and icons are extracted from the executable, but the generated manifest still uses `$targetnametoken$.exe`; this placeholder is resolved later (e.g. `winapp pack` or `winapp create-debug-identity`).

> **PS:** Keeping `$targetnametoken$` in your checked-in manifest avoids hard-coding executable names and works with both `winapp pack` and Visual Studio builds.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate standard manifest interactively
winapp manifest generate

# Generate with all options specified
winapp manifest generate ./src --package-name MyApp --publisher-name "CN=My Company" --if-exists overwrite
```

#### manifest add-alias

Add an execution alias (`uap5:AppExecutionAlias`) to a Package.appxmanifest. This allows launching the packaged app from the command line by typing the alias name.

```bash
winapp manifest add-alias [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--name <alias>` - Alias name (e.g. `myapp.exe`). Default: inferred from the `Executable` attribute in the manifest.
- `--manifest <path>` - Path to Package.appxmanifest (default: search current directory)
- `--app-id <id>` - Application Id to add the alias to (default: first Application element)

**What it does:**

- Reads the manifest and infers the alias from the `Executable` attribute (preserving placeholders like `$targetnametoken$.exe`)
- Adds the `uap5` namespace declaration if not already present
- Adds an `<Extensions>` block with `<uap5:AppExecutionAlias>` inside the target Application element
- If the alias already exists, reports it and exits successfully

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add alias inferred from Executable attribute (e.g. $targetnametoken$.exe)
winapp manifest add-alias

# Add alias with explicit name
winapp manifest add-alias --name myapp.exe

# Add alias to specific manifest
winapp manifest add-alias --manifest ./dist/Package.appxmanifest
```

#### manifest update-assets

Generate all required MSIX image assets from a single source image.

```bash
winapp manifest update-assets <image-path> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `image-path` - Path to source image file (PNG, JPG, SVG, ICO, GIF, BMP, etc.)

**Options:**

- `--manifest <path>` - Path to Package.appxmanifest file (default: search current directory)
- `--light-image <path>` - Path to a separate source image for light theme variants

**Description:**

Takes a single source image and generates a comprehensive set of MSIX image assets based on the manifest's asset references:

For each asset referenced in the manifest:
- **5 scale variants** — base (no suffix), `.scale-125`, `.scale-150`, `.scale-200`, `.scale-400`

For the app icon (Square44x44Logo / AppList, 44×44 base):
- **14 plated targetsize variants** — `.targetsize-{16,20,24,30,32,36,40,48,60,64,72,80,96,256}`
- **14 unplated targetsize variants** — `.targetsize-{size}_altform-unplated`

Additionally:
- **app.ico** — Multi-resolution ICO file (16, 24, 32, 48, 256) for shell integration. If an existing `.ico` file is found in the assets directory (e.g. `AppIcon.ico` from a project template), it is replaced in-place rather than creating a duplicate

With `--light-image`:
- **Light theme targetsize variants** — `.targetsize-{size}_altform-lightunplated` (app icon)
- **Light theme scale variants** — `.scale-{factor}_altform-colorful_theme-light` (tiles, store logo)

**SVG support:** SVG files are fully supported as source images. They are rendered as vectors directly at each target size, producing pixel-perfect results at all resolutions. The file must declare its own size, through either a `viewBox` or absolute `width` and `height` attributes; a percentage width with no `viewBox` describes no particular size. A source that declares neither is rejected with `SVG image has no usable dimensions` instead of producing blank assets.

The command scales images proportionally while maintaining aspect ratio, centering them with transparent backgrounds when needed. Assets are saved to the `Assets` directory relative to the manifest location.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate assets with auto-detected manifest
winapp manifest update-assets mylogo.png

# Use an SVG source for best quality at all sizes
winapp manifest update-assets mylogo.svg

# Specify manifest location explicitly
winapp manifest update-assets mylogo.png --manifest ./dist/Package.appxmanifest

# Generate light theme variants from a separate image
winapp manifest update-assets mylogo.png --light-image mylogo-light.png

# Use the same image for both (generates all MRT light theme qualifiers)
winapp manifest update-assets mylogo.png --light-image mylogo.png

# With verbose output
winapp manifest update-assets mylogo.png --verbose
```

### run

Create a loose layout package from a build output folder, register it with Windows using the `Windows.Management.Deployment.PackageManager` API, and launch the application — simulating a full MSIX install for debugging. Returns the process ID for debugger attachment.

`winapp run` operates in one of three modes, chosen automatically from the input:

- **Folder mode** — the input is a build-output folder (contains a `Package.appxmanifest`/`AppxManifest.xml`).
- **Project mode** — the input is a `.csproj`, a `.sln`/`.slnx` solution, or a directory containing one. `winapp run` builds the project and launches it, supporting both **packaged** and **unpackaged** WinUI apps. See [Project mode](#project-mode-net-sdk-projects) below.
- **Single-file mode** — the input is a `.cs` [.NET file-based app](#single-file-mode-net-file-based-apps). `winapp run` builds it, generates a manifest from its `#:property` directives, and launches it with package identity.

> [!TIP]
> Mode selection is silent by default. If a directory was treated as a build-output folder when you
> expected it to be built as a project, re-run with `--verbose` — folder mode reports why it was
> chosen (`No .csproj/.sln/.slnx with a runnable app found in '<path>' — running it as a
> build-output folder.`). A directory is only built as a project when a `.csproj`/`.sln`/`.slnx`
> with a runnable app sits at its **top level**; it is not searched recursively.

> **This is the preferred command for debugging with package identity** for most frameworks (.NET, C++, Rust, Flutter, Tauri). Unlike [`create-debug-identity`](#create-debug-identity) which registers a sparse package for a single exe, `winapp run` registers the entire folder as a loose layout package, just like a real MSIX install. See the [Debugging Guide](debugging.md) for common debugging workflows.

```bash
winapp run [<input>] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `input` - The app to run: a build-output folder (folder mode), a `.cs` .NET file-based app (single-file mode), a `.csproj` project, a `.sln`/`.slnx` solution, or a directory containing one of those at its top level (project mode; the directory is not searched recursively). Use `.` to build/run the project in the current directory. **Optional — defaults to the current directory when omitted** (matches `dotnet run`).

**Options:**

- `--manifest <path>` - Path to Package.appxmanifest (default: auto-detect from input folder or current directory)
- `--output-appx-directory <path>` - Output directory for the loose layout (default: `AppX` inside the input folder). The default layout removes files no longer in the build; a custom directory keeps extra files. Use a fresh custom directory when you need a clean layout.
- `--args <string>` - Command-line arguments to pass to the application. Alternatively, use `--` followed by arguments to avoid escaping (e.g., `winapp run . -- --flag value`).
- `--no-launch` - Only create the debug identity and register the package without launching the application
- `--with-alias` - Launch the app using its execution alias instead of AUMID activation. The app runs in the current terminal with inherited stdin/stdout/stderr. Rarely needed: an app with `OutputType=Exe` already launches this way by default. winapp adds the required `uap5:ExecutionAlias` to the manifest it stages in the AppX layout, so no change to your checked-in manifest is needed; an alias the app declares itself is used as-is. Cannot be combined with `--no-launch`, `--detach`, `--without-alias`, or `--json`.
- `--without-alias` - Force AUMID activation for an app that would otherwise launch through an execution alias. A console app then runs without a console and prints nothing to this terminal. Cannot be combined with `--with-alias`.
- `--debug-output` - Capture `OutputDebugString` messages and first-chance exceptions from the launched application. Framework noise (WinUI, COM, DirectX) is filtered from console output; the full log file captures everything. If the app crashes, automatically captures a minidump and analyzes it to show the exception type, message, and stack trace with source file:line numbers (resolved from PDBs in the build output folder). Managed (.NET) crashes are analyzed instantly with no external tools. Native (C++/WinRT) crashes show module names and offsets. When the crashed app is a WinUI 3 app (`Microsoft.UI.Xaml.dll` is loaded), an extra stowed-exception triage pass runs automatically to surface the originating HRESULT, its ErrorContext chain, and the full native XAML dispatch stack; the required debugger components are downloaded on first use (see [Debugging](debugging.md#winui-stowed-exception-triage), overridable via the `WINAPP_DBGTOOLS_DIR` environment variable). Only one debugger can attach to a process at a time, so other debuggers (Visual Studio, VS Code) cannot be used simultaneously. Use `--no-launch` instead if you need to attach a different debugger. Cannot be combined with `--no-launch`. Cannot be combined with `--json`.
- `--symbols` - Download PDB symbols from Microsoft Symbol Server for richer native crash analysis with resolved function names. Only used with `--debug-output`. If omitted and a native crash occurs, the output will suggest adding this flag. This flag also improves the WinUI stowed-exception triage stack for WinUI 3 apps. First run downloads symbols and caches them locally; subsequent runs use the cache.
- `--unregister-on-exit` - Unregister the development package after the application exits. Only removes packages registered in development mode. Cannot be combined with `--no-launch`.
- `--detach` - Launch the application and return immediately without waiting for it to exit. Useful for CI/automation where you need to interact with the app after launch. Local runs print the PID; target runs print the scoped UI target. JSON includes the PID and target scope. Cannot be combined with `--no-launch`, `--debug-output`, `--with-alias`, or `--unregister-on-exit`.
- `--clean` - Remove the existing package's application data (LocalState, settings, etc.) before re-deploying. By default, application data is preserved across re-deployments.
- `--json` - Format output as JSON for programmatic consumption (e.g. CI/automation). Useful with `--detach` to capture the PID. Cannot be combined with `--with-alias` or `--debug-output`.
- `--on <target>` - Build on the host, then register and run in the target. Currently supports `sandbox`, with no fallback to local execution. Use `--detach` before follow-up UI commands. Sandbox `--debug-output` requires a packaged app. See [Windows Sandbox execution](sandbox-execution.md#running-and-rebuilding) for setup, runtime support, and detached-app lifetime.

**Application data persistence:**

By default, `winapp run` preserves your application's data (`LocalState`, `RoamingState`, `Settings`, etc.) when re-deploying. If your app writes data to `ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder` or `Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)` within the package context, that data will survive across `winapp run` invocations.

Use `--clean` when you need a fresh start (e.g., to reset corrupted state or test first-run behavior).

**What it does:**

- Locates or generates the Package.appxmanifest
- Creates and registers a debug identity using a loose layout package
- Computes the Application User Model ID (AUMID)
- Launches the application using the registered identity (unless `--no-launch` is specified)
- Prints the process ID (PID) for debugger attachment

**Examples:**

```bash
# Register debug identity and launch app from build output
winapp run ./bin/Debug

# Launch with custom manifest and arguments
winapp run ./dist --manifest ./out/Package.appxmanifest --args "--my-flag value"

# Pass arguments after -- to avoid escaping (equivalent to --args)
winapp run ./bin/Debug -- --my-flag value

# Specify output directory for loose layout package
winapp run ./bin/Release --output-appx-directory ./AppXDebug

# Register identity without launching
winapp run ./bin/Debug --no-launch

# Launch via execution alias (console apps run in current terminal)
winapp run ./bin/Debug --with-alias

# Launch and capture OutputDebugString messages and crash diagnostics
winapp run ./bin/Debug --debug-output

# Download native symbols for richer crash analysis (C++/WinRT crashes)
winapp run ./bin/Debug --debug-output --symbols

# Combine with execution alias to debug console apps inline
winapp run ./bin/Debug --with-alias --debug-output

# Run and automatically clean up registration on exit
winapp run ./bin/Debug --with-alias --unregister-on-exit

# Launch and detach immediately (useful for CI/automation)
winapp run ./bin/Debug --detach

# Detach with JSON output (returns PID for scripting)
winapp run ./bin/Debug --detach --json

# Wipe application data (LocalState, settings) and start fresh
winapp run ./bin/Debug --clean
```

#### Project mode (.NET SDK projects)

When the input is a `.csproj`, a `.sln`/`.slnx` solution, or a directory containing one (including `.`), `winapp run` **builds the project** with `dotnet build` and then launches it. It supports both packaged and unpackaged WinUI apps, and installs the matching-architecture Windows App Runtime the app needs before launching.

**Solution input:** point `winapp run` at a `.sln`/`.slnx` (or a directory containing one — a solution is preferred over loose `.csproj` files) and it resolves the runnable app project, then builds it with `$(SolutionDir)` and the sibling `Solution*` properties defined, so projects that depend on them build as they do in Visual Studio. Resolution rules:

- **Test projects are skipped** when auto-selecting, so a solution containing an app plus its tests resolves to the app with no `--project` needed. (A WinUI test project is itself a packaged app, so output type alone can't distinguish it.)
- **If the only runnable project is a test project**, it runs.
- **If more than one runnable app project exists**, `winapp run` does not guess a startup project — it errors listing the candidates. Use `--project <name>` to choose, which is always honored, including to select a test project.

Packaged vs. unpackaged is detected automatically from the project's effective `WindowsPackageType` MSBuild property (never from manifest presence):

- **Packaged** (`WindowsPackageType=MSIX`, the WinUI packaged default) — builds, then registers the build output as a loose-layout package and launches via AUMID (the same pipeline as folder mode).
- **Unpackaged** (`WindowsPackageType=None`) — builds, ensures the framework-dependent Windows App Runtime is installed, then launches the built `.exe` directly. Force this for a packaged project with `-p WindowsPackageType=None`.

Project mode requires the **.NET SDK 8.0.100 or newer** (for MSBuild `--getProperty`).

**Native AOT:** add this property group inside the project file's `<Project>` element, then add `--aot`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
</PropertyGroup>
```

```powershell
winapp run . --aot
winapp run . --aot -c Release
```

`--aot` supports x64 and ARM64 projects. It runs `dotnet publish` with the project's AOT configuration, then launches that output; use `-p PublishAot=true` for a one-time override. It does not perform separate runtime certification and cannot be combined with `--no-build` or `--manifest`.

For apps that use package identity without a generated MSIX layout, include `Package.appxmanifest` or `appxmanifest.xml` in the project's publish output. Winapp stages the published files with that manifest. If both names are present, winapp stops instead of choosing one; remove the stale manifest and configure the project to publish only the intended manifest.

**Project-mode options** (ignored in folder mode unless noted):

- `-c, --configuration <name>` - Build configuration. Default: `Debug`. *(Also honored in single-file mode.)*
- `--arch <x64|arm64|x86>` - Target architecture. Default: the current process architecture. Determines the build RID and Windows App Runtime architecture, and selects a matching platform-dependent publish profile when required by the effective build. *(Also honored in single-file mode.)*
- `-r, --runtime <rid>` - Target .NET runtime identifier (e.g. `win-x64`). Project mode uses only the RID's architecture, always builds the canonical `win-<arch>`, and rejects non-Windows RIDs (e.g. `linux-x64`). Its architecture overrides `--arch` and can select the required publish profile. *(Also honored in single-file mode, where it overrides a `#:property RuntimeIdentifier` declared by the file.)*
- `-f, --framework <tfm>` - Target framework moniker for multi-targeted projects (e.g. `net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`). *(Rejected in single-file mode — use `#:property TargetFramework=...`.)*
- `--project <name-or-path>` - When the input is a solution (`.sln`/`.slnx`) or a directory with multiple runnable app projects, selects which project to launch (by project name or path). *(Rejected in single-file mode — a `.cs` file-based app is itself the project.)*
- `--no-build` - Skip building and run the existing build output (still evaluates output properties). *(Also honored in single-file mode.)*
- `--no-restore` - Skip restoring before building or Native AOT publishing. *(Also honored in single-file mode.)*
- `--aot` - Run the project's configured .NET Native AOT publish. Requires effective `PublishAot=true`. Rejected in folder and single-file modes.
- `-p, --property <Name=Value>` - MSBuild property, forwarded to both the build and the property evaluation. Repeat `-p` for multiple properties; use `%3B` or `%2C` for a literal semicolon or comma in a value. *(Also honored in single-file mode, where it is the only way to set `TargetFramework`.)*

**Build output & verbosity:** an ordinary project run uses `dotnet build`, then evaluates the built output. Restore and build output stream live, with credentials from authenticated feed URLs redacted. With `--aot`, winapp uses `dotnet publish`; `--verbose` shows the publish command and resolved paths. Use the verbosity options below to control what is shown:

| Flag | dotnet verbosity | Adds |
|------|------------------|------|
| *(default)* | `minimal` | — |
| `--verbose` | `minimal` | winapp's build decision traces |
| `--quiet` | `quiet` | — |

Native AOT publish output streams as it arrives, including MSBuild's final property JSON. Under `--json`, restore/build invocations and child output go to stderr so stdout stays pure JSON. Under `--quiet`, invocations are suppressed and dotnet's quiet restore/build output is routed to stderr so stdout stays clean. Native AOT publish output also goes to stderr under either option.

**Option applicability:** the identity/loose-layout options (`--manifest`, `--output-appx-directory`, `--no-launch`, `--with-alias`, `--unregister-on-exit`, `--clean`, `--executable`) apply to packaged apps only. They are rejected with a clear error for unpackaged apps (which have no MSIX package). Launch/debug options (`--args`/`--`, `--detach`, `--debug-output`, `--symbols`, `--json`) work in both.

**Project-mode examples:**

```bash
# Build and run the project in the current directory (input defaults to ".")
winapp run

# Run a specific project
winapp run ./src/MyApp/MyApp.csproj

# Build and run from a solution (resolves the runnable app project, defines $(SolutionDir))
winapp run ./MyApp.sln

# Pick a startup project when the solution has more than one runnable app
winapp run ./MyApp.sln --project MyApp

# Release build for arm64
winapp run . -c Release --arch arm64

# Publish and run the Release configuration with Native AOT
winapp run . --aot -c Release

# Force an unpackaged run of a packaged project
winapp run . -p WindowsPackageType=None

# Run the existing build output without rebuilding, and capture crash diagnostics
winapp run . --no-build --debug-output

# Show winapp's build decision traces (dotnet build stays at minimal verbosity)
winapp run . --verbose

# Launch and detach (prints PID), forwarding args to the app
winapp run . --detach -- --my-flag value
```

#### Single-file mode (.NET file-based apps)

.NET 10 lets you run a single `.cs` file with no project file, configuring it with `#:` directives at
the top. Point `winapp run` at that file and it builds the app, generates an appxmanifest for it, and
launches it **with package identity** — so `Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current` works, the app
gets a real AUMID and a Start-menu entry, and the APIs that simply require identity (app notifications,
`ApplicationData`, on-device AI) work.

Shell integrations such as protocol handlers, file associations, share targets, and startup tasks need
a declared `<Extensions>` entry, which the generated manifest does not contain. To add one, author your
own manifest — see [Bring your own manifest](#bring-your-own-manifest) below.

```bash
winapp run counter.cs
```

Or run it with plain `dotnet run` — see [Running with `dotnet run`](#running-with-dotnet-run) below.

You do not author a manifest. Describe the package with `#:property` directives instead:

```csharp
#:package Microsoft.UI.Reactor@0.1.0-preview.13
#:property OutputType=WinExe
#:property TargetFramework=net10.0-windows10.0.22621.0
#:property UseWinUI=true
#:property RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64

#:property WinAppPackageName=com.contoso.counter
#:property WinAppDisplayName=Contoso Counter
#:property WinAppDescription=Counts things, one click at a time
#:property Version=1.2.3

using static Microsoft.UI.Reactor.Factories;
ReactorApp.Run<MyApp>("Hello");
```

**Manifest properties.** All are optional; each falls back to a sensible default:

| Property | Sets | Default |
|----------|------|---------|
| `WinAppPackageName` | `Identity/@Name` (the package identity) | the file name, sanitized to `[-.A-Za-z0-9]`, plus a short hash of the file's path (`counter.cs` → `counter-a1b2c3d4`) |
| `WinAppDisplayName` | The name shown in Start and Settings | the file name without its extension |
| `WinAppPublisher` | `Identity/@Publisher` | `CN=<your Windows user name>`. A bare name is wrapped as `CN=<name>`. |
| `WinAppVersion` | `Identity/@Version` | `$(Version)`, normalized (see below) |
| `WinAppDescription` | The description shown during install and in Settings | the display name |
| `WinAppCapabilities` | Capabilities to declare, separated by `;` or `,` | none |

**Version.** A package version must be exactly four numbers, each 0–65535. `WinAppVersion` (or, if you
don't set it, the standard `Version` property) is normalized to fit: any `-preview`/`-rc` suffix is
dropped and missing components are filled with zeros, so `#:property Version=1.2.3-preview.4` becomes
`1.2.3.0` and sets your assembly version and package version together. A value that can't be made to
fit — a component above 65535, or more than four components — is **rejected with an error** rather
than silently changed.

##### Capabilities

Your app runs full-trust with identity, which satisfies APIs that only require a packaged app. But some
APIs are gated on a declared capability regardless — the Windows AI APIs are the common case. (Shell
integrations such as protocol handlers and file associations are a third case: those need authored
`<Extensions>` entries, not a capability, so use [your own manifest](#bring-your-own-manifest) for
them.)

```csharp
#:property WinAppCapabilities=systemAIModels
```

That is all Phi Silica and the other on-device model APIs need from the manifest. Declare several by
separating them:

```csharp
#:property WinAppCapabilities=systemAIModels;internetClient;microphone
```

winapp writes each one into the element and XML namespace it actually requires, declares that
namespace, and raises `MaxVersionTested` when the capability needs a newer one. This matters more than
it sounds: capabilities are spread across several different elements, and the same list above becomes
three *different* shapes —

```xml
<systemai:Capability Name="systemAIModels" />
<Capability Name="internetClient" />
<DeviceCapability Name="microphone" />
```

Names winapp knows are written for you. For anything else — the restricted set grows over time —
qualify it yourself with the namespace prefix:

| Prefix | Emits |
|--------|-------|
| `rescap:` | `<rescap:Capability>` — restricted capabilities |
| `uap:`, `uap6:`, `uap7:`, `uap11:` | `<uap*:Capability>` |
| `systemai:` | `<systemai:Capability>` |
| `device:` | `<DeviceCapability>` |
| `app:` | `<Capability>` in the default namespace |

```csharp
#:property WinAppCapabilities=rescap:broadFileSystemAccess
```

An unrecognized bare name is **rejected with an error** naming these prefixes, rather than guessed at —
a capability emitted in the wrong namespace produces a manifest Windows either refuses to register or
accepts while silently not granting it.

##### Bring your own manifest

If you need something the properties don't cover — a protocol handler, a file association, an execution alias — author a manifest
and `winapp run` will use it verbatim instead of generating one. It is picked up from, in order:

1. `--manifest <path>` on the command line.
2. `#:property WinAppManifestPath=<path>` in the `.cs` file.
3. A manifest sitting next to the `.cs` file, named `<filename>.appxmanifest` (for example
   `counter.appxmanifest` beside `counter.cs`).

Only that per-file name is picked up automatically. A `Package.appxmanifest` or `appxmanifest.xml` in
the same folder is deliberately ignored — several `.cs` files can share a folder, and adopting a
shared name would silently run one app under another's identity. To use one manifest for several
files, name it explicitly with `--manifest` or `WinAppManifestPath`.

Otherwise a `Package.appxmanifest` is generated into the build output, along with the default image
assets, and refreshed on every run.

**Options.** Every folder-mode option works: `--no-launch`, `--with-alias`, `--without-alias`, `--detach`,
`--clean`, `--debug-output`, `--symbols`, `--unregister-on-exit`, `--args`/`--`, `--json`, `--executable`,
`--manifest`, `--output-appx-directory`, plus `-c/--configuration`, `--no-build`, `--no-restore`, and
`-p/--property`.

> [!TIP]
> **A console app prints to your terminal by default.** A packaged app launched through AUMID has no

The alias winapp declares is named after the **package family name**, with a `winapp-` prefix — so
`com.contoso.counter` published by `CN=You` gets `winapp-com.contoso.counter_gspb8g6x97k2t.exe`. That
trailing part is the publisher hash Windows derives, so two apps sharing a name under different
publishers still get different aliases. The prefix keeps the name clear of real commands: an app in
`python.cs` gets a `winapp-…` alias, never `python.exe`. If you author your own manifest, the alias you
declare there is used as-is and winapp adds nothing.

That applies to the alias only. Registration itself is keyed on the package *name*, so running a second
app that declares the same `WinAppPackageName` under a different publisher replaces the first
registration rather than sitting alongside it. Give each app its own name if you want both registered
at once.

`winapp run` prints the alias it registered, so you don't have to compute the hash to find it.

The alias is a command on your PATH that lasts as long as the package stays registered. If some other
package already owns the name, winapp says so. When it inferred the alias for you it launches via AUMID
instead, rather than starting the wrong app; when you asked for one explicitly — with `--with-alias` or
`#:property WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias=true` — it fails instead of quietly doing something else.

Two project-mode options do **not** apply, because a file-based app configures itself. They are
rejected with a message naming the directive to use instead:

| Option | Use instead |
|--------|-------------|
| `-f/--framework` | `#:property TargetFramework=net10.0-windows10.0.22621.0` |
| `--project` | nothing — the `.cs` file *is* the project |

`--arch` and `-r/--runtime` work as they do in project mode. When you don't pass either, winapp builds
for **your machine's architecture** — which is what a self-contained Windows App SDK app needs, since
without it the SDK builds `AnyCPU` and fails with `WindowsAppSDKSelfContained requires a supported
Windows architecture`. A `#:property RuntimeIdentifier=win-arm64` in the file is respected; an explicit
`--arch`/`--runtime` overrides it.

**Packaged and unpackaged both work**, detected from the effective `WindowsPackageType` exactly as in
project mode: the default registers a loose layout and launches it with identity, while
`#:property WindowsPackageType=None` builds the app, installs the matching Windows App Runtime, and
launches the `.exe` directly. (A packaged app is launched through its execution alias or through AUMID
activation — see the console note above; that choice is separate from whether it is packaged.) The
identity options (`--no-launch`, `--with-alias`, `--without-alias`, `--clean`, `--unregister-on-exit`,
`--manifest`, `--output-appx-directory`) apply to packaged apps only.

##### Running with `dotnet run`

You don't have to type `winapp` at all. Reference the
[`Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools.WinApp`](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/blob/main/src/winapp-NuGet/README.md) package from the file and
plain `dotnet run` gives you the same packaged launch:

```csharp
#:package Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools.WinApp@*
#:property OutputType=Exe
#:property TargetFramework=net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0

System.Console.WriteLine(Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.Id.FamilyName);
```

```bash
dotnet run counter.cs
```

The package's MSBuild targets redirect the run to winapp, which packages, registers, and launches the
app that `dotnet run` just built — it is not rebuilt. Manifest handling is unchanged: winapp resolves
it exactly as it does for `winapp run`, so `#:property WinAppManifestPath=…` and a
`<filename>.appxmanifest` beside the `.cs` are both honoured (see
[Bring your own manifest](#bring-your-own-manifest)), a directory-wide `Package.appxmanifest` is still
ignored, and otherwise one is generated from your `#:property` directives and refreshed every run.

Two conditions have to hold for the redirect to happen:

| Directive | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `#:package Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools.WinApp@*` | the targets doing the redirect ship in this package |
| `#:property TargetFramework=net10.0-windows…` | a plain `net10.0` file is left alone, so it runs unpackaged |

Adding `#:property WindowsPackageType=None` also leaves the file alone: `dotnet run` then runs the
`.exe` directly, without identity. Use `winapp run` for the unpackaged path if you want the matching
Windows App Runtime installed first.

Set `#:property EnableWinAppRunSupport=false` to opt out of the redirect entirely, and the
`WinAppRun*` properties described under
[Configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/blob/main/src/winapp-NuGet/README.md#configuration) to shape the launch — for example:

```csharp
#:property WinAppRunUnregisterOnExit=true
```

If `dotnet run` runs the app unpackaged when you expected identity, ask MSBuild why. Use
`dotnet build`, not `dotnet msbuild` — only `dotnet build` synthesizes the virtual project that a
file-based app is compiled through:

```bash
dotnet build counter.cs -t:WinAppRunSupportInfo
```

Single-file mode requires the **.NET SDK 10.0.300 or newer**.

**The registration outlives the run.** `winapp run counter.cs` leaves the package registered after the
app exits, exactly like folder and project mode — so `LocalState` survives, and re-running the same
file reuses the same identity rather than piling up registrations. winapp says so the first time it
registers an app, and `winapp unregister` takes the `.cs` itself:

```bash
# Remove the registration (resolves the same identity `winapp run` registered)
winapp unregister counter.cs

# Or remove it as soon as the app exits
winapp run counter.cs --unregister-on-exit
```

`winapp unregister counter.cs` needs no manifest path: it evaluates the file's `#:property` values the
same way `run` does, and removes only a package registered from *that* file's build output. A
same-named app registered from a different folder is refused unless you pass `--force`. If the run used
an option that shapes the identity or the layout, pass the same one to `unregister`:

```bash
winapp run counter.cs -p WinAppPackageName=com.contoso.alt
winapp unregister counter.cs -p WinAppPackageName=com.contoso.alt

winapp run counter.cs -c Release --arch arm64
winapp unregister counter.cs -c Release --arch arm64
```

`-p` overrides the file's own directives, and a `Directory.Build.props` beside the `.cs` can key
`WinAppPackageName` off `$(Configuration)` or `$(RuntimeIdentifier)` — so each of these can change which
package gets registered.

Once the SDK's temp output has been cleaned, `winapp unregister counter.cs` can no longer confirm the
registration came from that file and will skip it — use `winapp unregister --prune` to clear
registrations whose files are gone, or `--force` to remove a specific one anyway. If the run used
`--output-appx-directory`, pass the same directory to `unregister` so it can recognize the layout.

The same applies to a custom output path: ownership is confirmed from the SDK's standard
`<root>\bin\<configuration>` layout, so a run built with `-p OutputPath=<somewhere-else>` cannot be
matched to its source file. `unregister` skips it rather than guessing at a wider directory — name the
layout with `--output-appx-directory`, or use `--force`.

**Single-file examples:**

```bash
# Build and run a file-based app with package identity
winapp run counter.cs

# Register identity without launching (e.g. to attach Visual Studio)
winapp run counter.cs --no-launch

# Release build, detached, printing the PID as JSON
winapp run counter.cs -c Release --detach --json

# Capture OutputDebugString output and crash diagnostics
winapp run counter.cs --debug-output

# Forward arguments to the app
winapp run counter.cs -- --verbose --input data.json

# Wipe the app's LocalState and start fresh
winapp run counter.cs --clean

# Remove the package it registered
winapp unregister counter.cs
```

> [!NOTE]
> The default identity includes a short hash of the file's path — `counter.cs` becomes something like
> `counter-a1b2c3d4` — so two `counter.cs` files in different folders are different apps and keep their
> own settings and `LocalState`. The hash is derived from the path, so it survives edits and re-runs and
> only changes if you move the file. Set `#:property WinAppPackageName=<name>` to choose a stable
> identity yourself; it is normalized to what `Identity/@Name` allows — characters outside
> `[-.A-Za-z0-9]` are dropped, names shorter than 3 characters are padded with `1`, and the result is
> capped at 50 characters, so `My App` registers as `MyApp`. Either way the Start menu and Settings show
> your `WinAppDisplayName` (default: the file name), not the identity. Identity is always scoped to your
> user account, so it never collides with another user on the same machine.

**MSBuild properties (NuGet package):**

When using the `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools.WinApp` NuGet package, `dotnet run` automatically invokes `winapp run`.

Everything written after `dotnet run` is passed to **your application**, exactly as it would be without the package. Configure the launcher with the MSBuild properties below:

```powershell
# Goes to your app. `--` is optional here, but required when the flag is also a
# `dotnet run` option (--configuration, --framework, --project, -c, -f, -r, ...),
# otherwise the SDK claims it and your app never sees it.
dotnet run --devtools
dotnet run -- --devtools
dotnet run -- --configuration Release

# Configures WinApp; --devtools still reaches your app
dotnet run -p:WinAppRunDetach=true --devtools
```

The following MSBuild properties can be set in your `.csproj` to control behavior:

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EnableWinAppRunSupport` | `true` | Enable/disable the run support functionality |
| `WinAppLaunchArgs` | (empty) | Arguments to pass to the app on launch |
| `WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias` | inferred from the app | Launch via execution alias instead of AUMID activation. Left unset, winapp infers it: a console app uses an alias so its output reaches the terminal, a windowed app uses AUMID. Set `true` or `false` to decide it yourself. |
| `WinAppRunNoLaunch` | `false` | Only register identity without launching |
| `WinAppRunDebugOutput` | `false` | Capture `OutputDebugString` messages and first-chance exceptions. Only one debugger can attach at a time (prevents VS/VS Code). Use `WinAppRunNoLaunch` instead to attach a different debugger. |
| `WinAppRunDetach` | `false` | Return immediately after launching instead of waiting for the app to exit. Prints the PID. |
| `WinAppRunUnregisterOnExit` | `false` | Unregister the development package after the app exits |
| `WinAppRunClean` | `false` | Remove the existing package's application data (LocalState, settings) before re-deploying |
| `WinAppRunSymbols` | `false` | Download symbols from the Microsoft Symbol Server for richer native crash analysis. Only has an effect with `WinAppRunDebugOutput`. |
| `WinAppRunExecutable` | (empty) | Executable path relative to the build-output folder. Use when the manifest contains `$targetnametoken$` and the output folder has more than one `.exe`. |
| `WinAppRunArgs` | (empty) | Raw arguments appended to the `winapp run` command line, for options with no dedicated property (for example `--verbose`). Appended after every property above. |

**Mutually exclusive settings.** `WinAppRunNoLaunch` and `WinAppRunDetach` each describe a different
launch behavior, so they conflict with the other launch properties and with each other. Setting a
conflicting pair fails the run with `--X and --Y cannot be used together`:

| Property | Cannot be combined with |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `WinAppRunNoLaunch` | `WinAppRunDetach`, `WinAppRunDebugOutput`, `WinAppRunUnregisterOnExit` |
| `WinAppRunDetach` | `WinAppRunNoLaunch`, `WinAppRunDebugOutput`, `WinAppRunUnregisterOnExit` |

`WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias` is deliberately **not** in that list, in either direction. `false` asks
for AUMID activation, which no-launch and detach already use; `true` is simply not applied when
either is set, because an execution alias needs a tracked, running process. So a project that checks
in `<WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias>true</WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias>` still runs cleanly under
`dotnet run -p:WinAppRunDetach=true`, launching via AUMID rather than failing.

`WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias`, `WinAppRunDebugOutput`, and `WinAppRunUnregisterOnExit` can be combined
with each other. `WinAppRunClean`, `WinAppRunSymbols`, `WinAppRunExecutable`, and `WinAppLaunchArgs`
have no restrictions. `WinAppRunArgs` adds no restriction of its own, but a switch passed through it
is checked like any other, so `WinAppRunArgs="--detach"` still conflicts with `WinAppRunNoLaunch`.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias>true</WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias>
  <WinAppRunDebugOutput>true</WinAppRunDebugOutput>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### unregister

Unregister a sideloaded development package. Only removes packages that were registered in development mode (e.g., via `winapp run` or `create-debug-identity`). Store-installed or MSIX-installed packages are never removed.

```bash
winapp unregister [input] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `input` - Path to a .NET file-based app (a single `.cs`) whose package should be unregistered. Its identity is resolved the same way `winapp run` resolves it — from an authored manifest if the app has one, otherwise from its `#:property` values — so no manifest path is needed. Omit to use `--manifest` or auto-detect a manifest in the current directory. Cannot be combined with `--manifest`, which names the package a different way and can resolve to a different one.

**Options:**

- `--manifest <path>` - Path to Package.appxmanifest (default: auto-detect from current directory)
- `--force` - For local unregister only, skip the install-location directory check and unregister even if the package was registered from a different project tree. It is rejected with `--on`; target ownership checks cannot be bypassed.
- `--on <target>` - Remove the matching winapp-owned development registration from `sandbox`, not this machine. Requires a manifest and does not support `--force`. See [Sandbox app cleanup](sandbox-execution.md#removing-an-app-and-ending-the-sandbox).
- `--prune` - Remove every development-mode registration whose files are gone. Cannot be combined with an input, `--manifest`, `--property`, `--configuration`, `--arch`, `--runtime`, or `--output-appx-directory`.
- `-p, --property <Name=Value>` - MSBuild property used when resolving a `.cs` file-based app's identity. Repeatable. Pass the same identity-affecting properties the run used (e.g. `-p WinAppPackageName=...`), since a command-line property overrides the file's own `#:property` directives. Only applies to a `.cs` input.
- `-c, --configuration <name>` - Build configuration used when resolving a `.cs` file-based app's identity. Default: `Debug`. Pass the same configuration the run used: a `Directory.Build.props` beside the `.cs` can set `WinAppPackageName` or `WinAppManifestPath` conditionally on `$(Configuration)`. Only applies to a `.cs` input.
- `--arch <x64|arm64|x86>` - Target architecture used when resolving a `.cs` file-based app's identity. Default: the current process architecture. Pass the same architecture the run used, since identity can also be keyed off `$(RuntimeIdentifier)`. Only applies to a `.cs` input.
- `-r, --runtime <rid>` - Target .NET runtime identifier (e.g. `win-x64`) used when resolving a `.cs` file-based app's identity. Only its architecture is used, and it overrides `--arch`. Only applies to a `.cs` input.
- `--output-appx-directory <path>` - The AppX layout directory the package was registered from. Only needed when the run used `--output-appx-directory`, since nothing on the package records which run option produced its layout.
- `--json` - Format output as JSON

**What it does:**

- Determines the package name — from the `.cs` file's resolved identity, or by reading the manifest
- Searches for both `{name}` and `{name}.debug` packages (the debug variant is created by `create-debug-identity`)
- Verifies each package was registered in development mode (`IsDevelopmentMode == true`)
- Verifies the package belongs to the app you named (unless `--force`) — its install location must sit under a directory you identified: the `.cs` file's own build output, the manifest's directory, the current directory, or an explicit `--output-appx-directory`. A package whose install location cannot be resolved (its files were deleted) is **skipped**, because identity alone is not proof of ownership: two apps that both set `#:property WinAppPackageName=counter` register the same identity from different folders. Use `--prune` to clear registrations whose files are gone.
- Unregisters matching packages

**Cleaning up dead registrations (`--prune`):**

A registration outlives its files. Delete a build output, project tree, or (for a file-based app) let
Windows clean `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp`, and the package stays registered: Windows keeps the identity and
its Start menu entry, but activation **silently does nothing**. These accumulate invisibly.

```bash
# List dev registrations whose files are gone, then confirm before removing
winapp unregister --prune

# Skip the prompt (required for non-interactive/CI use)
winapp unregister --prune --force
```

Only development-mode registrations are considered, and each is removed by its full package name, so a
same-named package still installed from a live location is untouched. The prompt exists because a
missing install location is *usually* a deleted folder but also describes a package registered from a
disconnected network share or removable drive — review the list before confirming.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Unregister from current directory (auto-detects manifest)
winapp unregister

# Unregister a .NET file-based app by its source file
winapp unregister counter.cs

# Unregister with explicit manifest
winapp unregister --manifest ./Package.appxmanifest

# Force unregister even if registered from a different project tree
winapp unregister --force

# Remove every dev registration whose files are gone
winapp unregister --prune

# JSON output for scripting
winapp unregister --json
```

---

### cert

Generate, inspect, and install development certificates.

#### cert generate

Generate development certificates for package signing.

```bash
winapp cert generate [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--manifest <Package.appxmanifest>` - Extract the certificate publisher from the manifest's `Identity/@Publisher`. Only the publisher is required, so a partially-complete manifest still works. If the manifest has no usable publisher, the command fails instead of substituting a default, so the certificate can never silently mismatch the manifest.
- `--publisher <name>` - Publisher for the certificate. When generating a certificate, this option takes precedence over `--manifest`; an explicitly empty value fails instead of using the manifest publisher. Accepts a full X.500 distinguished name (e.g., `CN=Contoso, O=Contoso Ltd, C=US`) or a bare name which is automatically wrapped as `CN=<name>`. Components must be single-valued and comma-separated; multi-valued RDNs (`CN=Foo+OU=Bar`) and backslashes are not supported because the MSIX manifest publisher cannot represent them. A malformed distinguished name (e.g. `CN=` or `CN=A,,O=B`) is rejected with a non-zero exit and an error naming the problem, rather than producing a certificate that can never match the manifest publisher.
- `--output <path>` - Output certificate file path (supports absolute and relative paths)
- `--password <password>` - Certificate password (default: `password`, which is publicly known — see [JSON output](#cert-generate-json-output) and [Security](security.md#the-default-password))
- `--valid-days <valid-days>` - Number of days the certificate is valid (default: 365)
- `--install` - Install the certificate to the local machine store after generation
- `--if-exists <Error|Overwrite|Skip>` - Set behavior if the certificate file already exists (default: Error)
- `--export-cer` - Export a `.cer` file (public key only) alongside the `.pfx`. Useful for distributing the public certificate separately for trust installation.
- `--json` - Format output as JSON for programmatic consumption. Errors are also returned as JSON (`{"error": "..."}`).

<a id="cert-generate-json-output"></a>

**JSON output:**

```json
{
  "certificatePath": "C:\\app\\devcert.pfx",
  "password": "password",
  "defaultPasswordIsPublic": true,
  "publisher": "Contoso",
  "subjectName": "CN=Contoso",
  "warnings": [
    "Protected with the default password ('password'), which is public. Treat this certificate as development-only: anyone who obtains the .pfx can sign as you. Pass --password to choose your own, and use a CA-issued certificate or Azure Trusted Signing to ship."
  ]
}
```

`publisher` is the display name and `subjectName` the full distinguished name the certificate was
issued to. `defaultPasswordIsPublic` is always present. When it is `true`, the `.pfx` is protected by
a password anyone can guess, so the certificate must only sign builds that stay on your own machines
— check it before a script hands the certificate to anything else. `warnings` carries the same
disclosure as text and is omitted when there is nothing to report. `publicCertificatePath` appears
only with `--export-cer`.

#### cert info

Display certificate details from a PFX or CER file. Useful for verifying a certificate matches your manifest before signing.

```bash
winapp cert info <cert-path> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `cert-path` - Path to the certificate file (PFX or CER)

**Options:**

- `--password <password>` - Password for the PFX file, ignored for a public CER (default: "password")
- `--json` - Format output as JSON

#### cert install

Install certificate to machine certificate store.

```bash
winapp cert install <cert-path> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `cert-path` - Path to certificate file to install

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate certificate for specific publisher
winapp cert generate --publisher "CN=My Company" --output ./mycert.pfx

# Generate certificate and export public key .cer file
winapp cert generate --publisher "CN=My Company" --export-cer

# Generate certificate with JSON output (for scripting)
winapp cert generate --publisher "CN=My Company" --json

# View certificate details
winapp cert info ./mycert.pfx

# View certificate details as JSON
winapp cert info ./mycert.pfx --json

# Install certificate to machine
winapp cert install ./mycert.pfx
```

---

### sign

Sign MSIX packages and executables with certificates.

```bash
winapp sign <file-path> <cert-path> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `file-path` - Path to MSIX package or executable to sign
- `cert-path` - Path to the signing certificate (.pfx)

**Options:**

- `--password <password>` - Certificate password (default: "password")
- `--timestamp <url>` - RFC 3161 timestamp server URL

**Examples:**

```bash
# Sign MSIX package
winapp sign MyApp.msix ./mycert.pfx

# Sign executable with a non-default certificate password
winapp sign ./bin/MyApp.exe ./mycert.pfx --password mypassword
```

---

### az-sign

Code-sign a file (exe, MSIX, or MSIX bundle) using [Azure Trusted Signing](/azure/trusted-signing/) — a cloud-managed signing identity, so no private key (PFX) ever lives on the local machine.

```bash
winapp az-sign <file-path> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `file-path` - Path to the file to sign (exe, msix, or msixbundle)

**Options:**

- `--subscription`, `-s` - Azure subscription ID to use. If not provided and multiple subscriptions exist, you will be prompted
- `--resource-group`, `-r` - Resource group to narrow down signing accounts
- `--account` - Signing account name. Must be used with `--resource-group`
- `--profile`, `-p` - Certificate profile name. Must be used with `--account`
- `--metadata-file`, `-m` - Path to an existing `metadata.json`. Skips resource discovery and account/profile selection prompts and signs directly. A non-interactive Azure credential should already be available; the CLI can otherwise fall back to an interactive tenant prompt or `az login`, but the npm programmatic API is always non-interactive and fails instead of prompting

**Authentication:**

`az-sign` uses Azure's standard credential chain (`DefaultAzureCredential`). For CI/CD, set `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` (or use GitHub Actions OIDC / managed identity). An existing Azure CLI session (`az login`, including the `azure/login` GitHub Action) is also honored in any environment. Only when no credentials are found *and* the session is interactive will `az-sign` launch `az login` for you.

**Prerequisites:**

- An Azure Code Signing account and a certificate profile (created in the Azure portal after identity validation), plus the **Code Signing Certificate Profile Signer** role assigned to your identity. For more guidance, visit [Azure Artifact Signing quickstart docs.](/azure/artifact-signing/quickstart)
- A machine-wide **x64 .NET 8 (or later) runtime** installed. The Azure signing client library is a managed assembly that `signtool.exe` loads in a separate process; winapp's own self-contained runtime does not satisfy it. Install it from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download if signing fails with a runtime-load error.
- The **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)**. The Azure signing client library depends on the VC++ runtime, and because winapp downloads the raw NuGet package rather than the official client-tools installer, this dependency is **not** installed automatically. A clean machine can load-fail even with .NET and SignTool present. Install the latest x64 redistributable from https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe if signing fails with a `0xc000007b`, "The application was unable to start correctly", or missing-DLL error from the dlib.

> **Least-privilege CI:** Auto-discovery (listing subscriptions, resource groups, accounts, and profiles) needs read access at a parent scope. To avoid *every* collection-listing call, pass all four of `--subscription`, `--resource-group`, `--account`, and `--profile`: `az-sign` then validates the account and profile with direct resource reads (a GET on each named resource) instead of enumerating the parent collection, so a principal scoped to just that account and profile is sufficient. Omitting any one of them re-introduces a listing call — for example, leaving out `--subscription` makes `az-sign` list the subscriptions your identity can access — which a narrowly-scoped principal may not be permitted to do. A principal scoped only to a single certificate profile can skip validation entirely by passing a pre-generated `--metadata-file` (which specifies the account endpoint and profile directly).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive — discover/select subscription, account, and profile
winapp az-sign ./app.msix

# Fully specified — no prompting (ideal for CI/CD)
winapp az-sign ./app.msix --subscription <sub-id> --resource-group <rg> --account <account> --profile <profile>

# Reuse an existing metadata.json (skips resource discovery and selection; authentication may still prompt)
winapp az-sign ./app.msix --metadata-file ./metadata.json
```

### create-external-catalog

Generate a `CodeIntegrityExternal.cat` catalog file containing hashes of executable files from specified directories. This catalog is used with the [TrustedLaunch](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-trustedlaunch-trustedlaunch) flag in MSIX sparse package manifests ([AllowExternalContent](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-uap10-allowexternalcontent)) to allow execution of external files not included in the package itself.

This is similar to how `signtool.exe` creates `AppxMetadata\CodeIntegrity.cat` when signing an MSIX package, but generates an external catalog for use with [sparse/external location packaging](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/grant-identity-to-nonpackaged-apps).

```bash
winapp create-external-catalog <input-folder> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `input-folder` - One or more directories containing executable files to process. Separate multiple directories with semicolons (e.g., `"dir1;dir2"`)

**Options:**

- `--recursive`, `-r` - Include files from subdirectories
- `--use-page-hashes` - Include page hashes when generating the catalog (produces a larger catalog with per-page hash data)
- `--compute-flat-hashes` - Include flat file hashes when generating the catalog
- `--if-exists <Error|Overwrite|Skip>` - Behavior when the output file already exists (default: `Error`)
- `--output`, `-o` - Output catalog file path. If not specified, `CodeIntegrityExternal.cat` is created in the current directory. If a directory is specified, the default filename is appended.

**What it does:**

- Scans specified directories for executable files (PE binaries with code sections)
- Generates a Catalog Definition File (CDF) with hashes of all found executables
- Uses Windows CryptoCAT APIs to produce the `.cat` catalog file
- Non-executable files (e.g., `.txt`, `.dll` without code sections) are automatically skipped

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate catalog for all executables in a directory
winapp create-external-catalog ./bin

# Include files in subdirectories
winapp create-external-catalog ./bin --recursive

# Specify a custom output path
winapp create-external-catalog ./bin --output ./dist/CodeIntegrityExternal.cat

# Overwrite existing catalog
winapp create-external-catalog ./bin --if-exists Overwrite

# Skip generation if catalog already exists
winapp create-external-catalog ./bin --if-exists Skip

# Include page hashes (for stricter code integrity validation)
winapp create-external-catalog ./bin --use-page-hashes

# Process multiple directories
winapp create-external-catalog "./bin;./lib" --recursive

# Combine multiple options
winapp create-external-catalog ./bin --recursive --use-page-hashes --compute-flat-hashes --output ./dist/CodeIntegrityExternal.cat --if-exists Overwrite
```

**When to use:**

Use this command when building a sparse MSIX package that uses TrustedLaunch to verify external executables. The typical workflow is:

1. `winapp manifest generate --template sparse` — Create a sparse manifest with `AllowExternalContent`
2. `winapp create-external-catalog ./bin` — Generate the code integrity catalog for your app's executables  
3. `winapp pack` — Package the manifest, assets, and catalog into an MSIX

### tool

Access Windows SDK tools directly. Uses tools available in [Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools/)

```bash
winapp tool <tool-name> [tool-arguments]
```

**Available tools:**

- `makeappx` - Create and manipulate app packages
- `signtool` - Sign files and verify signatures
- `mt` - Manifest tool for side-by-side assemblies
- And other Windows SDK tools from [Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools/)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use signtool to verify signature
winapp tool signtool verify /pa MyApp.msix
```

**Signature verification**

Build tools are downloaded from NuGet and then executed, so winapp checks each one for a valid Microsoft Authenticode signature immediately before running it. The certificate must name Microsoft Corporation as the signing organization. This applies to every command that shells out to an SDK tool, including `tool`, `package`, and `sign`. A tool that fails the check is not run:

```text
'mt.exe' is not validly signed by Microsoft, so it was not run (C:\...\mt.exe).
```

A failure here means the file on disk is not what Microsoft published — most often a corrupt or partial download. Delete the package from the NuGet cache and run the command again so winapp re-downloads it.

winapp then keeps the tool open for as long as it runs, so the file it checked is the file Windows loads. If it cannot hold the tool in place, it is not run either:

```text
'mt.exe' could not be held open for verification, so it was not run (C:\...\mt.exe).
```

Close whatever is using the file — an antivirus scan or an open editor is the usual cause — and run the command again. If the tool is gone rather than in use, delete the package from the NuGet cache so winapp re-downloads it.

---

### store

Run a Microsoft Store Developer CLI command. This command will download the Microsoft Store Developer CLI if not already downloaded. Learn more about the [Microsoft Store Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/msstoredevcli).

```bash
winapp store [args...]
```

**Arguments:**

- `args...` – Arguments to pass directly to the `msstore` CLI. See [MSStore CLI documentation](https://aka.ms/msstoredevcli/docs) for available commands and options.

**What it does:**

- Ensures the Microsoft Store Developer CLI (`msstore`) is downloaded and available on your system.
- Forwards all arguments to the `msstore` CLI.
- Runs the command showing output directly in your terminal.

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all apps in your Microsoft Partner Center account
winapp store app list

# Publish a package to the Microsoft Store
winapp store publish ./myapp.msix --appId <your-app-id>
```

---

### get-winapp-path

Get paths to installed Windows SDK components.

```bash
winapp get-winapp-path [options]
```

**What it returns:**

- Paths to `.winapp` workspace directory
- Package installation directories
- Generated header locations

---

### target

Run commands, copy files, inspect state, or capture the whole guest desktop.

Every verb takes `sandbox` as its first argument. Except for `snapshot`, these commands
can prepare or start the Sandbox. See [Windows Sandbox execution](sandbox-execution.md)
for prerequisites, permissions, lifecycle, and recovery.

#### target exec

Run a command as the guest user.

```powershell
winapp target exec <target> [--cwd <path>] [--json] -- <executable> [arguments...]
winapp target exec sandbox -- dotnet --info
```

Arguments after `--` retain their boundaries. Standard streams and the guest process's
exit code are forwarded; this is not a full terminal. `--json` formats winapp failures
on stderr without changing the child command's stdout. Use the structured `error.code`
to distinguish a target failure from an application's own exit status.

An explicit `WINAPP_UI_WORKFLOW_ID` also groups guest UI calls made by the command;
see [Sandbox UI coordination](sandbox-execution.md#coordinating-ui-workflows-in-the-sandbox).

#### target push and target pull

Copy a file or directory in the direction named by the verb.

```powershell
winapp target push <target> <host-source> <target-destination> [--json]
winapp target pull <target> <target-source> <host-destination> [--json]
winapp target push sandbox .\setup.ps1 Setup\setup.ps1
winapp target pull sandbox Results .\results
```

Target paths are relative to the target's managed work area; absolute, rooted, and UNC target paths
are rejected. A file destination includes its filename. See
[Running commands and copying files](sandbox-execution.md#running-commands-and-copying-files)
for directory layout, link handling, and running a copied script.

#### target snapshot

Report readiness, deployments, and guest windows without starting a Sandbox.

```powershell
winapp target snapshot <target> [--json]
winapp target snapshot sandbox
```

It does not reconnect a client or repair an agent. No running Sandbox is a successful
result, not an error. See [Inspecting the Sandbox](sandbox-execution.md#inspecting-the-sandbox)
for interpreting readiness and process IDs.

#### target screenshot

Capture the guest desktop at its native pixel size as a host PNG, without an app
selector or host window borders. `--json` reports the guest coordinate origin.

```powershell
winapp target screenshot <target> [-o <host-path>] [--json]
winapp target screenshot sandbox -o .\sandbox.png
```

Use `ui screenshot --on sandbox -a <app>` for an app window instead. See
[Screenshots and recordings](sandbox-execution.md#screenshots-and-recordings) for
client requirements, focus limitations, and output handling.

#### target record

Record the guest desktop to H.264 MP4. Host video and frame files arrive after
recording finishes; JSON and the frame manifest describe any scaling or padding.

```powershell
winapp target record <target> [-o <host-path>] [--duration-sec <n>] [--fps <n>] [--max-edge <px>] [--frames] [--overwrite] [--json]
winapp target record sandbox -o .\sandbox.mp4 --duration-sec 20 --fps 15
```

Uses the duration, frame, overwrite, and result options of [`ui record`](#ui-record),
but captures the desktop rather than one app. Prefer a positive `--duration-sec` for
unattended CLI use; the npm helper requires `durationSec`. See
[Sandbox capture](sandbox-execution.md#screenshots-and-recordings) for partial evidence
and capture-readiness failures.

### find-ui

> **Agent-first.** `find-ui` is built primarily for AI coding agents — it lets an agent pull real, compiling WinUI markup from the shipping galleries instead of inventing it, and `--json` makes every result (and every failure) machine-readable. It works just as well typed by hand.

Search **WinUI** controls and samples for a working code example. WinUI-only: the corpus is the [WinUI 3 Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery) and the [Windows Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Windows) (plus a few curated core patterns) — it does **not** cover WPF, WinForms, or other UI frameworks. A third source, the [microsoft-ui-reactor ReactorGallery](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-reactor), is **opt-in**: it is excluded from a normal search and only searched when you pass `--source reactor` (its C#-only declarative samples don't paste into a standard XAML app, so reach for it only when building a Reactor/MVU project).

```bash
winapp find-ui "<query>" [options]
```

The Gallery, Toolkit, and Reactor corpora ship **inside the CLI**, so `find-ui` works with no network access — including on a first run in an agent sandbox or behind a corporate proxy that blocks `raw.githubusercontent.com`. When GitHub *is* reachable the CLI refreshes from it and caches the result per-user under `<global .winapp>/cache/find-ui`; the built-in corpus is only a floor, never a ceiling. Cached data is refreshed at most every 24 hours, or on demand with `--refresh`.

The built-in corpus is re-fetched from GitHub every time a stable release is built, and a refresh that fails **stops the release build** rather than quietly shipping older data — the baker fetches through the same code path `--refresh` uses, so a failure there means the live refresh is broken too and is worth investigating before shipping. A release can still be cut against the previously committed corpus, but only as an explicit override. When results are served from the built-in copy of the Gallery/Toolkit/Reactor corpora, `find-ui` says so on stderr and `--json` output carries `"corpus": "embedded"` (other values: `"network"` for a fresh fetch, `"cache"` for the local cache). A core-only request — `--source core`, or an `--id` set that is all core patterns — reports `"embedded"` too, because the curated core patterns are compiled into the CLI and never fetched; it prints no staleness notice, since `--refresh` cannot change them. The `corpus` field is reported whenever results were served; it is absent only when no corpus could be loaded at all.

**Options:**

- `--id <id>` - Fetch the code (Gallery/Toolkit return XAML and/or C#; Reactor is C#-only) plus prerequisite notes for one or more scenario ids from a prior search (e.g. `gallery-tabview-1`). Repeatable. **Ids are case-insensitive** — `GALLERY-TABVIEW-1` resolves the same as `gallery-tabview-1`.
- `--list` - List every discoverable control/sample id instead of searching (Gallery + Toolkit + core; the opt-in Reactor source is excluded).
- `--source <gallery|toolkit|reactor|core>` - Restrict search results to a single source. (Search only — not valid with `--list`/`--id`.) **Reactor is opt-in** — it is excluded from a normal search, so `--source reactor` is the only way to search it.
- `--max <N>` - Maximum number of matched controls to return (default: 3). Applies to search only; ignored with `--list`/`--id`.
- `--refresh` - Bypass the local cache and re-fetch the WinUI corpus from GitHub.
- `--json` - Emit structured JSON (agent-friendly). For search, each match carries `source`, `control`, `score`, `description`, and a `scenarios` array whose entries hold the per-scenario `id` and `header`; for `--id`, full code. Under `--json` **every** failure — including argument/parser errors such as a non-integer `--max` — is emitted as a flat `{"error": "..."}` object on stdout with a non-zero exit code, so output stays machine-readable.

**Workflow:** search compactly to find the right control and its scenario ids, then fetch the full code for the best match with `--id`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Find a control by intent (compact results with scenario ids)
winapp find-ui "tabbed layout"

# Restrict to the Windows Community Toolkit
winapp find-ui "settings card" --source toolkit

# Restrict to Reactor (opt-in; C#-only declarative WinUI — Reactor projects only)
winapp find-ui "flex layout" --source reactor

# Fetch the full XAML + C# for a specific scenario
winapp find-ui --id gallery-tabview-1

# Agent-friendly structured output
winapp find-ui "color picker" --json

# Browse everything, or force a corpus refresh
winapp find-ui --list
winapp find-ui "navigation view" --refresh
```

**Related:** `find-ui` searches WinUI *samples*; use [`find-api`](#find-api) to search the *API surface* (types, members, enums) a project references, and `winapp ui search` to search a *running app's* UI tree.

---

### find-api

> **Agent-first.** `find-api` is built primarily for AI coding agents — it grounds generated code in the API surface a project actually references instead of the model's recollection of it, and `--json` plus non-zero exit codes on missing symbols let an agent gate codegen on the answer. It works just as well typed by hand.

Search and inspect the Windows/WinRT API surface (types, members, enums, namespaces) available to a project, resolved from its referenced `.winmd`/`.dll` metadata. The bare form searches; sub-verbs drill into a specific type, namespace, or the index itself.

```bash
winapp find-api "<query>" [options]
winapp find-api [command] [options]
```

The index is built from the project's restored NuGet/SDK packages (via `project.assets.json`) on first use and refreshed automatically when the project is restored. It lives under the global `.winapp` cache (`cache/find-api/`) and is shared across projects. Restore the project first (`winapp restore` or `dotnet restore`).

Each match is listed under its namespace with the package that ships it and a one-line summary of what it does, so a result is usable without a second `members` call:

```text
[40] Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Media
    Class Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Media.AcrylicBrush  [Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.WinUI 1.8.260224000]
        Paints an area with a semi-transparent material that uses multiple effects including blur and a noise texture.
```

Add `--verbose` to also print the on-disk cache file backing each namespace, which is useful when diagnosing a stale or unexpected index.

Running `winapp find-api` with no query at all prints a short usage summary and exits `0` — it is a request for help, not a search that found nothing.

**Scopes.** Every answer comes from exactly one scope, reported as `scope` in `--json` and as a note in text output:

- **`project`** - the project in the current directory (or `--project` / `--project-dir`). Covers the Windows SDK, the Windows App SDK, *and* the project's own NuGet packages. The Windows App SDK metadata is the release the project **references**: if the machine has a newer Windows App Runtime installed, `find-api` warns and leaves it out rather than confirming types the project cannot compile against.
- **`sdk`** - the machine-wide Windows SDK + Windows App SDK metadata, used automatically when the current directory contains **no project and no solution**. This makes `find-api` usable for exploring APIs before any project exists, and needs no network access. It deliberately does **not** include third-party NuGet packages, so a type from (say) the Community Toolkit will not be found in this scope.

A query from a directory with no project and no solution is *always* answered by the `sdk` scope - never by whichever project happens to be indexed in the shared cache - so results never depend on unrelated global state. Pass `--project sdk` to select the SDK scope explicitly from inside a project, and `winapp find-api refresh --project sdk` to rebuild it after installing a new Windows SDK.

**Solution directories.** From a directory holding a `.sln`/`.slnx` with no project file beside it, the projects the solution builds answer instead of the `sdk` scope - they are indexed on demand, so their NuGet packages are included. When the solution builds more than one indexed project, the query lists them and asks for `--project <name>` rather than picking one.

**Commands:**
- *(bare)* `find-api "<query>" ["<query>"...]` - Search type and member names, falling back to their documented summaries, grouped by namespace
- `members <type> [<type>...] [--filter <text>]` - List a type's properties, events, and methods (declared members with signatures, inherited members summarized by declaring type)
- `check-property <type> <property> [<property>...]` - Validate properties exist on a type (exits non-zero if any is missing). A **read-only** property is reported with ⚠️ and "read-only, cannot be assigned" rather than a plain ✅, so a property such as `ActualWidth` is not mistaken for something you can set. Property names are matched **case-sensitively**, because C# and XAML are: `check-property Button background` exits non-zero and offers `Background` as a near match rather than reporting a name you cannot actually write.
- `enums <type> [<type>...] [--filter <text>]` - List an enum's values (exits non-zero when the type is not an enum)
- `packages` - List the indexed metadata packages, with per-package type/member counts
- `stats` - Show aggregate index statistics (packages, namespaces, types, members, `.winmd` files)
- `refresh [--scan]` - Rebuild the index for a project (`--scan` indexes every project under the directory). With `--project <name>`, a name that matches no single indexed project fails instead of indexing the current directory.

**Batching.** `search`, `members`, `enums`, and `check-property` accept **multiple subjects in one invocation**. For an AI agent this is the single biggest cost lever: the marginal cost of a lookup is dominated by the round trip (each call re-sends the whole conversation), not by the size of the payload, so one call answering ten questions is far cheaper than ten calls.

- A **single** subject returns exactly the payload shape it always has, in both text and `--json`.
- **Two or more** subjects return an envelope — `{ "count": N, "results": [ ... ] }` in `--json`, with each element being the normal single-subject payload; `check-property` adds `missingCount`. Text output renders each subject in sequence under one scope header.
- `check-property` batches **properties on one type**: the first argument is the type, every argument after it is a property. In batch mode a property that exists prints a single ✅ line; full near-miss detail is printed only for ones that don't.
- A batch exits `0` only if **every** subject resolved *and* was found — so a batch is still safe to gate codegen on.

**Search ranking.** A query that exactly matches a type name is ranked ahead of partial matches, and when a short name is shared by several namespaces only the exact-name collisions are listed as ambiguous — a query like `NavigationView` reports the handful of namespaces that define that exact type rather than every namespace containing a similarly-named symbol. The ambiguity list obeys `--max`, and normal results are still printed underneath it.

**Type names.** `members`, `check-property`, and `enums` accept a short name (`NavigationView`) or a fully-qualified one (`Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.NavigationView`). When a short name is shared by a modern `Microsoft.*` type and its legacy `Windows.*` UWP twin, the `Microsoft.*` type answers — that is the projection a Windows App SDK app uses — and the resolved fully-qualified name is always shown. Any other collision exits non-zero and lists the candidates instead of guessing.

**Method signatures.** A signature is printed the way you would write the call: a method you call on the type rather than on an instance is shown with `static`, and a by-reference parameter is shown with the keyword it actually needs — `out`, `in`, or `ref`. So `TryGetValue` reads `Boolean TryGetValue(String key, out String value)`, which compiles as written.

**Options:**
- `--max <n>` - Maximum number of namespace-grouped search results (default `5`; search only). Also caps the ambiguity list, so a short query that collides across many namespaces stays readable.
- `--filter <text>` - Narrow a listing on `members` and `enums`: a **case-insensitive substring** match on the member/value name. Best used on types with hundreds of members. Most enums are small enough to dump whole (even `Symbol`, the largest in WinUI at 197 values), so filtering them usually costs more than it saves once you factor in a second guess. Never re-run the same command with different filter text — dump once and read it.
- `--all` - On `members`, list the complete surface: full signatures for inherited members, plus dependency-property identifier statics and per-member descriptions, all of which an unfiltered listing omits (see **Listing size** below). `--verbose` implies it; use `--all` when you also want `--json`, which cannot be combined with `--verbose`.
- `--scan` - Recursively discover and index every project under the directory (`refresh` only)
- `--project <name>` - Project to query (matches the `.csproj`/`.vcxproj` name), or `sdk` to query the machine-wide Windows SDK scope
- `--project-dir <path>` - Project directory to query (defaults to the current directory). A path that does not exist is an error — it is never silently answered from the `sdk` scope.
- `--json` - Emit a machine-readable payload on stdout (supported by every verb). Query payloads identify the index that answered via `scope` (`project` or `sdk`), `projectName`, and `projectDir` (absent for the SDK scope) — project names are not unique across directories, so `projectDir` is the reliable identity. Under `--json` **every** failure — including argument/parser errors such as a non-integer `--max` — is emitted as a flat `{"error": "..."}` object on stdout with a non-zero exit code, so output stays machine-readable.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Search
winapp find-api "acrylic brush"
winapp find-api NavigationView --max 10

# Inspect and validate
winapp find-api members Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.NavigationView
winapp find-api check-property Button Background
winapp find-api enums Symbol

# Batch — one call instead of one per subject
winapp find-api check-property InfoBar Severity IsOpen Message Title
winapp find-api members InfoBar TeachingTip ContentDialog
winapp find-api enums InfoBarSeverity Visibility
winapp find-api "acrylic brush" "teaching tip" --max 5

# Narrow a large type instead of dumping it and grepping
winapp find-api members Button --filter background

# Full member surface: inherited signatures, dependency-property statics, descriptions
winapp find-api members Button --all

# Manage the index
winapp find-api refresh

# Explore the Windows SDK with no project at all (e.g. before scaffolding an app)
winapp find-api "acrylic brush"          # from an empty directory -> scope: sdk
winapp find-api members Button --project sdk
```

When `--filter` is applied, the output still reports the unfiltered total (`totalValues`, or `totalProperties`/`totalEvents`/`totalMethods` in `--json`), so a narrow view is never mistaken for a small API. A filter that matches nothing still exits `0` and says so explicitly — that is "nothing matched your filter", not "no such type".

**Listing size.** An unfiltered `members` listing is the one expensive shape — `members Button` covers 288 members, of which 280 are inherited from 6 base types. An unfiltered call is an *orientation* query ("what is this type, roughly what can it do?"), so it answers that and omits the parts nothing is written from:

- **Inherited member signatures** — inherited members are grouped by declaring type and listed **by name only**, so the shape of the inherited surface is still visible without 280 full signatures.
- **Dependency-property identifier statics** (`BackgroundProperty`) — 28% of a typical WinUI control's properties. They exist to be passed to `GetValue`/`SetValue`, not assigned.
- **Per-member descriptions** — the XML-doc prose, roughly 16% of the payload.
- **Fields implied by their surroundings** in `--json`: `kind` (implied by the containing `properties`/`events`/`methods` array), `returnType` (the leading token of `signature`), and `inherited` when false (implied by `declaringType`).

What was omitted is always reported (`hiddenDependencyProperties`, `descriptionsOmitted`, and a `hint` in `--json`; an "Omitted:" line in text), and totals still describe the whole type. Both `--filter` and `--all` see the complete surface with full signatures and descriptions, so `members Button --filter BackgroundProperty` still finds the identifier and `members Button --filter Click` still returns `Click`'s inherited signature. Measured on `samples/winui-app`, this takes `members Button --json` from 91,954 to 10,567 characters (−88.5%) while leaving `--filter` and `--all` byte-identical.

**How a query is matched.** `winapp find-api "language model"` ranks `LanguageModel` above matches whose words are scattered across namespaces and members, including outside a project when the type is indexed. Search is lexical, not semantic: it matches whole identifier words rather than any run of letters, so `llm` finds `IImageLLMAdapterSession` but not `ScrollMode`. When a query matches no name, it is tried against the documented summaries of types and members, which is what lets `"random-access stream"` find `IRandomAccessStream`. Descriptions rank below every name match, and only summaries the packages actually ship are searchable — a package with no XML documentation contributes no description text.

**Projects without an MSBuild project file.** An Electron app (or any other non-.NET app driven by `winapp.yaml`) has no `.csproj` and therefore no `project.assets.json`. `find-api` indexes it from the `.winapp/winmds.lock.json` that `winapp restore` writes, which records the same thing: each resolved package, its version, and the `.winmd` files it contributes. Such a project is named after its directory, and its index goes stale when the lockfile is rewritten. A directory that holds both a `.csproj` and a `winapp.yaml` is indexed from the `.csproj`, which is the more precise description of what the project compiles against.

**Negative answers are qualified when the index is incomplete.** If a package's metadata could not be read, "no such type" and "that package was never indexed" look identical — and acting on the first when it is really the second generates code against an API you were told does not exist. So every negative answer, including a `search` that returns zero results, carries a note that the index is partial and points at `winapp find-api refresh`. Positive answers are unaffected.

**Generic type names.** Metadata stores generic types with an arity suffix (`` IAsyncOperation`1 ``), which is not how anyone writes them. `members`, `enums`, and `check-property` accept every form: `IAsyncOperation`, `IAsyncOperation<StorageFile>`, and `` IAsyncOperation`1 `` all resolve to the same type. A bare name matches any arity; a stated arity (in either notation) must match, so `Holder<A, B>` will not resolve to a single-parameter `Holder<T>`.

**`--json` payloads omit diagnostics.** Cache file paths appear only under `--verbose` (matching text output, where they were already verbose-only), and empty suggestion arrays are omitted rather than serialized as `[]`.

**Exit codes:** `search` with no hits, `check-property` on a missing property, and `enums` on a non-enum type all exit non-zero — gate code generation and CI checks on them. A batched invocation exits non-zero if *any* subject fails. A read-only property is *not* a failure — it exists, so `check-property` exits `0` and flags it in the output (`writable: false` in `--json`). An `init` property reports `writable: false` for the same reason: it can be set in an object initializer, and its signature says `{ get; init; }`, but assigning it afterwards does not compile.

**Related:** `find-api` answers "does this API exist and what are its members?"; use [`find-ui`](#find-ui) to find a working WinUI sample for a control.

### node generate-bindings

*(Available in NPM package only)* Generate JS bindings for Windows App SDK APIs. The bindings are declared by a `"winapp": { "jsBindings": {...} }` namespace in **`package.json`** and written to `.winapp/bindings/`.

```bash
npx winapp node generate-bindings [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--verbose`, `-v` - Enable verbose per-file codegen output
- `--quiet`, `-q` - Suppress progress and informational output

**What it does:**

- Reads the `winapp.jsBindings` block from `package.json` and the `winmds.lock.json` written by the last `winapp restore`, then emits typed `.js` + `.d.ts` bindings into `.winapp/bindings/`
- Does **not** modify `package.json` — it is a passive regenerator. Adding the `winapp.jsBindings` block and the `@microsoft/dynwinrt` runtime dependency happens during [`winapp init`](#init) when JS bindings are enabled; this command fails fast if the block is absent
- Warns (but does not write) if `@microsoft/dynwinrt` is missing from your dependencies — run `npm install` after `init` has added it

> [!NOTE]
> Bindings are **npm-only** — they require invocation via `npx winapp` (the `@microsoft/winappcli` npm package); the standalone winget CLI does not surface them. Run [`winapp init`](#init) interactively and opt in, or use `winapp init . --use-defaults --add-js-bindings`, before using this command to regenerate bindings. If you edit `winapp.yaml`, run `npx winapp restore` to refresh Windows dependencies before regenerating.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Regenerate JS bindings in the current project
npx winapp node generate-bindings

# Regenerate after editing winapp.jsBindings, with verbose output
npx winapp node generate-bindings --verbose
```

> See the [JS bindings guide](guides/electron-js-file-picker.md) for the end-to-end workflow and the `winapp.jsBindings` configuration options.

### node create-addon

*(Available in NPM package only)* Generate native C++ or C# addon templates with Windows SDK and Windows App SDK integration.

```bash
npx winapp node create-addon [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--name <name>` - Addon name (default: "nativeWindowsAddon")
- `--template` - Select type of addon. Options are `cs` or `cpp` (default: `cpp`)
- `--verbose` - Enable verbose output

**What it does:**

- Creates addon directory with template files
- Generates binding.gyp and addon.cc with Windows SDK examples
- Installs required npm dependencies (nan, node-addon-api, node-gyp)
- Adds build script to package.json

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate addon with default name
npx winapp node create-addon

# Generate custom named addon
npx winapp node create-addon --name myWindowsAddon
```

---

### node add-electron-debug-identity

*(Available in NPM package only)* Add app identity to Electron development process by using sparse packaging. Requires a Package.appxmanifest (create one with `winapp init` or `winapp manifest generate` if you don't have one).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is a known issue with sparse packaging Electron applications which causes the app to crash on start or not render the web content. The issue has been fixed in Windows but it has not propagated to external Windows devices yet. If you are seeing this issue after calling `add-electron-debug-identity`, you can [disable sandboxing in your Electron app](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/sandbox#disabling-chromiums-sandbox-testing-only) for debug purposes with the `--no-sandbox` flag. This issue does not affect full MSIX packaging.
<br /><br />
To undo the Electron debug identity, use `winapp node clear-electron-debug-identity`.

```bash
npx winapp node add-electron-debug-identity [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--manifest <path>` | Path to custom Package.appxmanifest (default: Package.appxmanifest in current directory) |
| `--no-install` | Do not install or modify dependencies; only configure the Electron debug identity |
| `--keep-identity` | Keep the manifest identity as-is, without appending `.debug` to the package name and application ID |
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose output |

**What it does:**

- Registers debug identity for electron.exe process
- Enables testing identity-requiring APIs in Electron development
- Uses existing Package.appxmanifest for identity configuration

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add identity to Electron development process
npx winapp node add-electron-debug-identity

# Use a custom manifest file
npx winapp node add-electron-debug-identity --manifest ./custom/Package.appxmanifest
```

---

### node clear-electron-debug-identity

*(Available in NPM package only)* Remove package identity from the Electron debug process by restoring the original electron.exe from backup.

```bash
npx winapp node clear-electron-debug-identity [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose output |

**What it does:**

- Restores electron.exe from the backup created by `add-electron-debug-identity`
- Removes the backup files after restoration
- Returns Electron to its original state without package identity

**Examples:**

```bash
# Remove identity from Electron development process
npx winapp node clear-electron-debug-identity
```

---

### Global Options

All commands support these global options:

- `--verbose`, `-v` - Enable verbose output for detailed logging
- `--quiet`, `-q` - Suppress progress messages
- `--help`, `-h` - Show command help

---

### Global Cache Directory

Winapp creates a directory to cache files that can be shared between multiple projects.

By default, winapp creates a directory at `$UserProfile/.winapp` as the global cache directory.

To use a different location, set the `WINAPP_CLI_CACHE_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

In **cmd**:
```cmd
REM Set a custom location for winapp's global cache
set WINAPP_CLI_CACHE_DIRECTORY=d:\temp\.winapp
```

In **PowerShell** and **pwsh**:
```pwsh
# Set a custom location for winapp's global cache
$env:WINAPP_CLI_CACHE_DIRECTORY=d:\temp\.winapp
```

Winapp will create this directory automatically when you run commands like `init` or `restore`.

### Update Checks

The winapp CLI periodically checks for new versions and displays a one-line notice when an update is available. This check runs in the background and adds no latency to commands.

Update checks are automatically disabled in CI environments (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, etc.).

To manually disable update checks, set the `WINAPP_CLI_UPDATE_CHECK` environment variable to `0`.

In **cmd**:
```cmd
set WINAPP_CLI_UPDATE_CHECK=0
```

In **PowerShell** and **pwsh**:
```pwsh
$env:WINAPP_CLI_UPDATE_CHECK = "0"
```

To make this permanent:
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('WINAPP_CLI_UPDATE_CHECK', '0', 'User')
```

### UI workflow identity

`winapp ui` commands that drive the physical desktop always take cooperative turns, so two workflows
running at once cannot steal each other's focus or dismiss each other's menus. That arbitration needs
no setup and cannot be switched off.

What is optional is *continuity*. By default each command is a self-contained one-shot that releases
the desktop as soon as it finishes. To keep the desktop across several commands, give them all the
same workflow id:

```pwsh
$env:WINAPP_UI_WORKFLOW_ID = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
```

Use the *same* value for cooperating processes (for example a recording and the clicks it should
capture) and *different* values for independent workflows. Every command without an id is its own
one-shot workflow, even when several are launched from one shell, so hosts that start a fresh shell
per command must inject the same explicit value into each one. The value is opaque, is never treated
as a credential, and is only ever persisted as a SHA-256 hash. See
[UI Automation → Coordinating concurrent UI workflows](ui-automation.md#coordinating-concurrent-ui-workflows).

### ui

Inspect and interact with running Windows app UIs using UI Automation (UIA).

```bash
winapp ui [command] [options]
```

**Commands:**
- `status` - Connect to app and show info
- `inspect` - View element tree
- `search` - Find elements by selector
- `get-property` - Read element properties
- `get-text` / `get-value` - Read value/text from element (TextPattern, ValuePattern, or Name)
- `screenshot` - Capture window/element as PNG (multiple windows form one labeled composite PNG; see [capture scope](ui-automation.md#screenshot))
- `record` - Record a window/element region to an H.264 MP4 video (Windows Graphics Capture + Media Foundation)
- `invoke` - Activate element (click, toggle, expand)
- `click` - Click element via mouse simulation (for controls that don't support invoke)
- `hover` - Move mouse to element to trigger tooltips, flyouts, and hover states (default dwell: 800ms)
- `drag` - Drag the mouse from one point to another, by element selector or screen `x,y` coordinates (reorder, resize, sliders, drag-and-drop)
- `touch` - Inject synthetic touch gestures (tap, double-tap, long-press, swipe, pinch, stretch) at an element center or screen `x,y` coordinates
- `pen` - Inject synthetic pen/stylus input — taps and ink strokes with configurable pressure, tilt, and eraser mode
- `send-keys` - Send synthetic keyboard input (named keys, combos, raw vk=0xNN, or literal text) to a window
- `set-value` - Set value on editable element (text, number); falls back to LegacyIAccessible `put_accValue` for TextPattern-only rich-edit controls
- `focus` - Move keyboard focus
- `scroll-into-view` - Scroll element visible
- `wait-for` - Wait for element state
- `list-windows` - List all windows for an app
- `get-focused` - Report the currently focused element
- `yield` - Release the current workflow's UI turn; requires `WINAPP_UI_WORKFLOW_ID`

**Options:**
- `-a, --app <app>` - Target app (name, title, or PID)
- `-w, --window <hwnd>` - Target window by HWND (stable)
- `--on <target>` - Run any `ui` verb in `sandbox`; names, PIDs, and window handles refer to the guest. Outputs are delivered to the host. See [Sandbox UI automation](sandbox-execution.md#automating-the-ui) for setup, workflow coordination, and client requirements.

#### ui record

Record a window or element region to an H.264 MP4.

```bash
# Record a window for 10 seconds at 15 fps
winapp ui record -a Calculator --duration-sec 10 --fps 15 -o demo.mp4

# Record until Ctrl+C, downscaled so the longest edge is 1280px
winapp ui record -a "My App" --duration-sec 0 --max-edge 1280 -o capture.mp4

# Record just one element's region
winapp ui record -a "My App" btn-save-1234 -o button.mp4

# Keep an agent-readable timeline alongside the MP4
winapp ui record -a Calculator --frames --duration-sec 10 --fps 10 -o evidence.mp4
```

**Record options:**
- `--duration-sec <n>` - Recording length in seconds. `0` records until Ctrl+C (default `0`).
- `--fps <n>` - Frames per second to capture (default `15`).
- `--max-edge <px>` - Downscale so the longest edge is at most this many pixels (`0` = no downscale).
- `--capture-screen` - Capture from the screen so overlays/popups are included (may capture occluding windows).
- `-o, --output <path>` - Output `.mp4` path (defaults to `recording-<timestamp>-<guid>.mp4`).
- `--overwrite` - Replace existing recording outputs after the new take finishes; existing outputs are rejected by default. Previous frame bundles are retained. See [Recording output recovery](ui-automation.md#record).
- `--frames` - Write timestamped JPEGs, `frames.ndjson`, and `manifest.json` to `<output-name>.frames`. Supports 1-30 fps and `--max-edge` 64-4096 (default 1280), with a 1 GiB frame-data cap.

With `--json`, the final result includes the output path, dimensions, codec, capture mode, cadence,
stop reason, optional `frameArtifacts`, and warnings.

> **Known limitation:** recording a *specific element* inside a popup that renders in its own
> top-level window (WinUI/XAML flyout, teaching tip, tooltip) may capture the underlying main
> window instead. Record the whole window, or follow the [screenshot overlay workflow](ui-automation.md#screenshot)
> for popup stills. Tracked in [#646](https://github.com/microsoft/winappCli/issues/646).
