# Using winapp CLI with .NET 

> This guide should work for most .NET project types. The steps have been tested with both console and UI-based projects like WPF. For working examples, check out the [dotnet-app](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/tree/main/samples/dotnet-app) (console) and [wpf-app](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/tree/main/samples/wpf-app) (WPF) samples in the samples folder.

This guide demonstrates how to use the `winapp` CLI with a .NET application to debug with package identity and package your application as an MSIX.

Package identity is a core concept in the Windows app model. It allows your application to access specific Windows APIs (like Notifications, Security, AI APIs, etc), have a clean install/uninstall experience, and more.

A standard executable (like one created with `dotnet build`) does not have package identity. This guide shows how to add it for debugging and then package it for distribution.

## Prerequisites

1.  **.NET SDK**: Install the .NET SDK (requires a restart after installation):
    ```powershell
    winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10 --source winget
    ```

2.  **winapp CLI**: Install the `winapp` tool via winget (or update if already installed):
    ```powershell
    winget install Microsoft.winappcli --source winget
    ```

## 1. Create a New .NET App

Start by creating a simple .NET console application:

```powershell
dotnet new console -n dotnet-app
cd dotnet-app
```

Run it to make sure everything is working:

```powershell
dotnet run
```
*Output should be "Hello, World!"*

## 2. Update Code to Check Identity

We'll update the app to check if it's running with package identity. We'll use the Windows Runtime API to access the Package APIs.

First, update your project file to target a specific Windows SDK version. Open `dotnet-app.csproj` and change the `TargetFramework` to include the Windows SDK version:

```xml
  <TargetFramework>net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0</TargetFramework>
```

This gives you access to Windows Runtime APIs without needing additional packages.

Now replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following code. This code attempts to retrieve the current package identity using the Windows Runtime API. If it succeeds, it prints the Package Family Name; otherwise, it prints "Not packaged".

```csharp
using Windows.ApplicationModel;

try
{
    var package = Package.Current;
    var familyName = package.Id.FamilyName;
    Console.WriteLine($"Package Family Name: {familyName}");
}
catch (InvalidOperationException)
{
    // Thrown when app doesn't have package identity
    Console.WriteLine("Not packaged");
}
```

## 3. Run Without Identity

Now, run the app as usual:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

You should see the output "Not packaged". This confirms that the standard executable is running without any package identity.

## 4. Initialize Project with winapp CLI

The `winapp init` command automatically detects `.csproj` files and runs a .NET-specific setup. It sets up everything you need in one go: validates your `TargetFramework`, adds required NuGet packages, generates the app manifest, and assets.

Run the following command and follow the prompts:

```powershell
winapp init
```

When prompted:
- **Package name**: Press Enter to accept the default (dotnet-app)
- **Publisher name**: Press Enter to accept the default or enter your name
- **Version**: Press Enter to accept 1.0.0.0
- **Description**: Press Enter to accept the default (Windows Application) or enter a description
- **Windows App SDK setup**: Select Stable, Preview, or Experimental (determines which Windows App SDK version is added)
- **TargetFramework update**: If your `TargetFramework` doesn't include a supported Windows SDK version, you'll be prompted to update it (e.g., to `net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`)
- **Developer Mode**: If you are prompted about "Developer Mode", you can turn it on if you would like, but be aware that it requires administrative privileges

This command will:
- Update the `TargetFramework` in your `.csproj` to a supported Windows TFM (if needed)
- Add `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`, `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools`, and `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools.WinApp` NuGet package references to your `.csproj`
- Create `Package.appxmanifest` and `Assets` folder for your app identity

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike native/C++ projects, the .NET flow does **not** create a `winapp.yaml` file. NuGet packages are managed directly via your `.csproj`. Use `dotnet restore` to restore packages after cloning.

You can open `Package.appxmanifest` to further customize properties like the display name, publisher, and capabilities.

To verify the packages were added to your project:

```powershell
dotnet list package
```

You should see `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` and `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools` in the output.

### Add Execution Alias (for console apps)

Because we're building a console app, we need to make sure `dotnet run` keeps console output in the current terminal. By default, `dotnet run` launches the packaged app via AUMID activation, which opens a new window — and the window closes immediately when the console app finishes, swallowing any output.

To fix this, you'll add an execution alias to the manifest and tell the run integration to launch via that alias instead.

> **Skip this step if you're building a UI app** (WPF, WinForms, WinUI). Those apps render their own window, so the default AUMID launch is what you want.

1. Add the execution alias to your manifest:

   ```powershell
   winapp manifest add-alias
   ```

   This adds a `uap5:ExecutionAlias` to `Package.appxmanifest` (defaulting to your project's exe name) so the app can be launched by name from a terminal.

2. Tell the `dotnet run` integration to use the alias. Open `dotnet-app.csproj` and add the following inside any `<PropertyGroup>` (or create a new `<PropertyGroup>` if needed):

   ```xml
   <WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias>true</WinAppRunUseExecutionAlias>
   ```

   With this property set, `dotnet run` launches the app via its execution alias and inherits the current terminal's stdin/stdout/stderr so you see console output inline.

## 5. Debug with Identity

Since `winapp init` added the `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools.WinApp` NuGet package to your project, you can simply run:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

This automatically invokes `winapp run` under the hood — creating a loose layout package, registering it with Windows, and launching your app with full package identity.

> [!NOTE]
> You may see NuGet vulnerability warnings (NU1900) about package sources. These are safe to ignore — they don't affect your build.

You should see output similar to:
```
Package Family Name: dotnet-app_12345abcde
```
This confirms your app is running with a valid package identity!

### Alternative: Manual `winapp run`

If you didn't use `winapp init` (or removed the NuGet package), you can build and run manually:

```powershell
dotnet build -c Debug
winapp run .\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0
```

To add the NuGet package back: `dotnet add package Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools.WinApp --prerelease`

> [!TIP]
> To disable the automatic `dotnet run` integration, add `<EnableWinAppRunSupport>false</EnableWinAppRunSupport>` to your `.csproj`. See [dotnet run support docs](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/blob/main/docs/dotnet-run-support.md) for customization options.

### Alternative: Sparse package identity

If you need sparse package behavior specifically (identity without copying files), you can use `create-debug-identity` instead. This registers a sparse package pointing to your exe rather than creating a loose layout:

```powershell
winapp create-debug-identity .\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0\dotnet-app.exe
```

Then run the executable directly (do not use `dotnet run` as it might rebuild/overwrite the file):
```powershell
.\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0\dotnet-app.exe
```

### Alternative: Manual MSBuild target

If you prefer not to use the NuGet package, you can add a custom MSBuild target that runs `create-debug-identity` after Debug builds. Add this to your `.csproj` file at the end, just before the closing `</Project>` tag:

```xml
  <!-- Automatically apply debug identity after Debug builds -->
  <Target Name="ApplyDebugIdentity" AfterTargets="Build" Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'">
    <Exec Command="winapp create-debug-identity &quot;$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).exe&quot;" 
          WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)" 
          IgnoreExitCode="false" />
  </Target>
```

With this configuration, `dotnet build` applies the debug identity and you can run the executable directly. Note that `dotnet run` may rebuild and overwrite the identity, so run the exe manually after building.

> [!TIP]
> For advanced debugging workflows (attaching debuggers, IDE setup, startup debugging), see the [Debugging Guide](../debugging.md).

> **When to skip this**: If you prefer explicit control over when identity is applied, or if you're working on code that doesn't need identity for most of your development cycle, the manual approach above may be simpler.

## 6. Using Windows App SDK (Optional)

The Windows App SDK gives you access to modern Windows APIs beyond what the base Windows SDK provides — things like the notification system, windowing APIs, app lifecycle management, and on-device AI. If your app needs any of these capabilities, this step is for you. If you just need package identity for distribution, you can skip to step 7.

If you ran `winapp init` (Step 4), `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` was already added as a NuGet package reference to your `.csproj`. You can verify with `dotnet list package`. If you skipped SDK setup during init, or need to add it manually, run:

```powershell
dotnet add package Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK
```

### Update Program.cs

Replace the entire contents of `Program.cs` with the following code, which adds a Windows App Runtime version check:

```csharp
using Windows.ApplicationModel;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            var package = Package.Current;
            var familyName = package.Id.FamilyName;
            Console.WriteLine($"Package Family Name: {familyName}");
            
            // Get Windows App Runtime version using the API
            var runtimeVersion = Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationModel.WindowsAppRuntime.RuntimeInfo.AsString;
            Console.WriteLine($"Windows App Runtime Version: {runtimeVersion}");
        }
        catch (InvalidOperationException)
        {
            // Thrown when app doesn't have package identity
            Console.WriteLine("Not packaged");
        }
    }
}
```

### Build and Run

Rebuild and run the application with Windows App SDK. Since we've added the WinAppSDK, we need to re-register with identity so `winapp` adds the runtime dependency. If you added the WinApp NuGet package (recommended), simply run `dotnet run`. Otherwise (replace `dotnet-app` with your project name):

```powershell
dotnet build -c Debug
winapp run .\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0
```

You should now see output like:
```
Package Family Name: dotnet-app.debug_12345abcde
Windows App Runtime Version: 8000.770.947.0
```

The Windows App SDK NuGet package includes all the necessary assemblies for accessing modern Windows APIs including:
- Notifications and live tiles
- Windowing and app lifecycle
- Push notifications
- And many more Windows App SDK components

For more advanced Windows App SDK usage, check out the [Windows App SDK documentation](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/).

## 7. Package with MSIX

Once you're ready to distribute your app, you can package it as an MSIX using the same manifest.

### Build for Release
First, build your application in release mode for optimal performance:

```powershell
dotnet build -c Release
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may see NuGet vulnerability warnings (NU1900). These are safe to ignore and don't affect your build output.

### Generate a Development Certificate

Before packaging, you need a development certificate for signing. Generate one if you haven't already:

```powershell
winapp cert generate --if-exists skip
```

### Sign and Pack

Now you can package and sign. Point the pack command to your build output folder (replace `dotnet-app` and the TFM path with your project's values):

```powershell
# package and sign the app with the generated certificate
winapp pack .\bin\Release\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0 --manifest .\Package.appxmanifest --cert .\devcert.pfx 
```

> Note: The `pack` command automatically uses the Package.appxmanifest from your current directory and copies it to the target folder before packaging. The generated .msix file will be in the current directory.

### Install the Certificate

Before you can install the MSIX package, you need to install the development certificate. Run this command as administrator:

```powershell
winapp cert install .\devcert.pfx
```

### Install and Run
Install the package by double-clicking the generated *.msix file.

Now you can run your app from anywhere in the terminal by typing:

```powershell
dotnet-app
```

You should see the "Package Family Name" output, confirming it's installed and running with identity.

> [!TIP]
> If you need to repackage your app (e.g., after code changes), increment the `Version` in your `Package.appxmanifest` before running `winapp pack` again. Windows requires a higher version number to update an installed package.

## Tips
1. Once you are ready for distribution, you can sign your MSIX with a code signing certificate from a Certificate Authority so your users don't have to install a self-signed certificate.
2. The Microsoft Store will sign the MSIX for you, no need to sign before submission.
3. You might need to create multiple MSIX packages, one for each architecture you support (x64, Arm64). Use the `-r` flag with `dotnet build` to target specific architectures: `dotnet build -c Release -r win-x64` or `dotnet build -c Release -r win-arm64`.

### Automating MSIX Packaging (Optional)

To automate MSIX packaging as part of your Release builds, add this target to your `.csproj` file (you can add it alongside the debug identity target):

```xml
  <!-- Automatically package as MSIX after Release builds -->
  <Target Name="PackageMsix" AfterTargets="Build" Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'">
    <!-- Package and sign directly from build output -->
    <Exec Command="winapp pack &quot;$(TargetDir.TrimEnd('\'))&quot; --cert &quot;$(ProjectDir)devcert.pfx&quot;" 
          WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)" 
          IgnoreExitCode="false" />
  </Target>
```

With this configuration:
- Building in Release mode (`dotnet build -c Release`) will automatically create the MSIX package
- The MSIX is packaged and signed with your development certificate
- The final `.msix` file will be in the root of the project

You can also create a custom configuration (e.g., `PackagedRelease`) by modifying the condition to `'$(Configuration)' == 'PackagedRelease'`.

## Next Steps

- **Distribute via winget**: Submit your MSIX to the [Windows Package Manager Community Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs)
- **Publish to the Microsoft Store**: Use `winapp store` to submit your package
- **Set up CI/CD**: Use the [`setup-WinAppCli`](https://github.com/microsoft/setup-WinAppCli) GitHub Action to automate packaging in your pipeline
- **Explore Windows APIs**: With package identity, you can now use [Notifications](/windows/apps/develop/notifications/app-notifications/app-notifications-quickstart), [on-device AI](/windows/ai/apis/), and other [identity-dependent APIs](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-extensions)
