# Packaging a CLI Executable as MSIX

This guide walks you through packaging an existing command-line executable as an MSIX package for distribution via Windows Package Manager (winget), the Microsoft Store, or direct distribution.

## Prerequisites

- An existing CLI executable (`.exe`) that you want to package
- Windows 10 version 1809 or later


## Steps

### 1. Organize Your CLI Application

Place your CLI executable and any dependencies in a dedicated folder. This folder will contain all files that should be included in your MSIX package.

```powershell
mkdir MyCliPackage
cd MyCliPackage
# Copy your CLI executable and dependencies here
```

### 2. Install winapp CLI

Install the winapp CLI via Windows Package Manager, or update to the latest version if you already have it:

```powershell
# Install (or update if already installed)
winget install microsoft.winappcli --source winget
```

### 3. Generate the Package.appxmanifest

Generate a base Package.appxmanifest and required assets for your CLI executable:

```powershell
winapp manifest generate --executable .\yourcli.exe
```

This command creates a `Package.appxmanifest` file in the current directory with default values populated from your executable.

### 4. Configure the Manifest

Edit the generated `Package.appxmanifest` to customize your package. Each sub-step below explains what to change and why.

#### 4.1 Add Required Namespace

Add the `uap5` namespace to the `Package` element if it's not already present. This is needed for the execution alias in step 4.3:

```xml
<Package
  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10"
  ...
  xmlns:uap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10"
  xmlns:uap5="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/5"
  xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities"
  IgnorableNamespaces="uap uap5 rescap">
```

#### 4.2 Configure the Application Element

In the `<uap:VisualElements>` element, add `AppListEntry="none"` to hide the app from the Start menu. CLI tools are invoked from the terminal, so they don't need a Start menu entry:

```xml
<uap:VisualElements
    DisplayName="YourApp"
    Description="My Application"
    BackgroundColor="transparent"
    Square150x150Logo="Assets\Square150x150Logo.png"
    Square44x44Logo="Assets\Square44x44Logo.png"
    AppListEntry="none">
</uap:VisualElements>
```

#### 4.3 Add Execution Alias Extension

Add an execution alias so users can run your CLI by name from any terminal window. Add this within the `<Application>` element (after `<uap:VisualElements>`):

```xml
<Extensions>
  <uap5:Extension Category="windows.appExecutionAlias">
    <uap5:AppExecutionAlias>
      <uap5:ExecutionAlias Alias="yourcli.exe" />
    </uap5:AppExecutionAlias>
  </uap5:Extension>
</Extensions>
```

Replace `yourcli.exe` with the desired command name for your CLI. Once a user installs the MSIX, they will be able to invoke your CLI with this command.

#### 4.4 Update Application Metadata

Update the following fields to match your CLI application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Publisher` value in your manifest must match the publisher in your signing certificate. If you generate a certificate later (step 5), it will use the publisher from your manifest. If you change the publisher after generating a certificate, you'll need to regenerate the certificate to match.

- **Identity**: Update `Name`, `Publisher`, and `Version`
  ```xml
  <Identity
    Name="YourCompany.YourCLI"
    Publisher="CN=Your Company"
    Version="1.0.0.0" />
  ```

- **Properties**: Update display name, publisher display name, and description
  ```xml
  <Properties>
    <DisplayName>Your CLI Tool</DisplayName>
    <PublisherDisplayName>Your Company</PublisherDisplayName>
    <Description>Description of your CLI tool</Description>
    <Logo>Assets\StoreLogo.png</Logo>
  </Properties>
  ```

- **VisualElements**: Update display name and asset references
  ```xml
  <uap:VisualElements
    DisplayName="Your CLI Tool"
    Description="Description of your CLI tool"
    BackgroundColor="transparent"
    Square150x150Logo="Assets\Square150x150Logo.png"
    Square44x44Logo="Assets\Square44x44Logo.png">
    <uap:DefaultTile Wide310x150Logo="Assets\Wide310x150Logo.png" />
    <uap:SplashScreen Image="Assets\SplashScreen.png" />
  </uap:VisualElements>
  ```

**Note**: You should also add proper icon assets to an `Assets` folder in your package directory. While the app won't appear in the Start menu, icons are still required for Store submission and may appear in other contexts.

### 5. (Optional) Generate a Development Certificate

For local testing and distribution outside the Microsoft Store, you'll need to sign your MSIX package with a certificate.

Generate a development certificate. Keep it outside your CLI folder to avoid accidentally including it in the package:

```powershell
# Navigate to a location outside your CLI folder (e.g., your home directory)
cd ~
winapp cert generate
```

This creates a `devcert.pfx` file in your home directory (e.g., `C:\Users\yourname\devcert.pfx`).

To trust this certificate on your development machine, install it (requires administrator privileges):

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
winapp cert install ~\devcert.pfx
```

### 6. Package Your CLI

Now you're ready to create the MSIX package:

```powershell
# Navigate back outside of your project folder
# Package with dev certificate (for local testing/distribution)
winapp pack .\path\to\MyCliPackage --cert .\path\to\devcert.pfx
```

This creates an `.msix` file in the current directory.

### 7. Install and Verify

Install the MSIX package to verify everything works:

```powershell
Add-AppxPackage .\MyCliPackage.msix
```

If you added an execution alias in step 4.3, you can now run your CLI from any terminal:

```powershell
yourcli --help
```

To uninstall later:

```powershell
Get-AppxPackage *YourCLI* | Remove-AppxPackage
```

## Tips

1. Once you are ready for distribution, you can sign your MSIX with a code signing certificate from a Certificate Authority so your users don't have to install a self-signed certificate
2. The Microsoft Store will sign the MSIX for you, no need to sign before submission.
3. To create a multi-architecture bundle (`.msixbundle`) for x64 + Arm64, pass multiple input folders:
   ```powershell
   winapp pack ./publish/x64 ./publish/arm64 --cert ./devcert.pfx
   ```

## Next Steps

- **Distribute via winget**: Submit your MSIX to the [Windows Package Manager Community Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs)
- **Publish to the Microsoft Store**: Use `winapp store` to submit your package
- **Set up CI/CD**: Use the [`setup-WinAppCli`](https://github.com/microsoft/setup-WinAppCli) GitHub Action to automate packaging in your pipeline
