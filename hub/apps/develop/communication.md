# Communication

This article provides an index of development features that are related to scenarios involving communication in Windows apps.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Windows App SDK](../windows-app-sdk/index.md) currently does not provide APIs related to communication scenarios.

## Windows OS features

Windows 10 and later OS releases provide a wide variety of APIs related to communication scenarios for apps. These features are available via a combination of WinRT and Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk).

#### WinRT APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via WinRT APIs provided by the Windows SDK.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [App-to-app communication](/windows/uwp/app-to-app/) | Learn how to share data between apps, including how to use the Share contract, copy and paste, drag and drop, and app services. |
| [Interprocess communication](/windows/uwp/communication/interprocess-communication) | Learn about ways to perform interprocess communication (IPC) between UWP apps, packaged desktop apps, and unpackaged desktop apps. |
| [Networking and web services](/windows/uwp/networking/) | Learn about networking and web services technologies that are available to apps. |
| [Sharing named objects](/windows/uwp/communication/sharing-named-objects) | Learn how to share named objects between UWP apps, packaged desktop apps, and unpackaged desktop apps. |

#### Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the Windows SDK.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Networking and Internet](/windows/win32/networking) | Learn about APIs, components, and services that support your app's use of networking and the Internet. |
| [Remote Procedure Call](/windows/win32/rpc/rpc-start-page) | Learn about using Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to create distributed client/server programs. |
| [Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock)](/windows/win32/winsock/windows-sockets-start-page-2) | Learn how to use Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock) to create advanced Internet, intranet, and other network-capable apps. |

## .NET features

The .NET SDK also provides APIs related to communication scenarios for WPF and Windows Forms apps.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Network programming in the .NET Framework](/dotnet/framework/network-programming/) | Learn about building network-enabled apps using .NET. |
| [Networking in Windows Forms](/dotnet/framework/winforms/advanced/networking-in-windows-forms-applications) | Learn about additional networking scenarios for Windows Forms apps. |
