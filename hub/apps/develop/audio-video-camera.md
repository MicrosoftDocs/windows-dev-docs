# Audio, video, and camera

This article provides an index of development features that are related to scenarios involving audio, video, and camera in Windows apps.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Windows App SDK](../windows-app-sdk/index.md) currently does not provide APIs related to audio, video, and camera scenarios.

## Windows OS features

Windows 10 and later OS releases provide a wide variety of APIs related to audio, video, and camera scenarios for apps. These features are available via a combination of WinRT and Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk).

#### WinRT APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via WinRT APIs provided by the Windows SDK.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Audio, video, and camera](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/) | Learn about development scenarios that involve photos, videos, or audio in your apps. |
| [Camera](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/camera) | Learn about how to use the camera or microphone to capture photos, video, or audio. |
| [Media playback](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/media-playback/) | Learn about how to play back audio and video in your apps. |
| [Visual layer](/windows/uwp/composition/visual-layer) | The Visual layer provides a high performance, retained-mode API for graphics, effects and animations, and is the foundation for all UI across Windows devices. |
| [XAML platform](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/) |  Describes the XAML language and concepts to apps that use a WinRT XAML-based UI, including XAML UI components provided by Windows 10 and later as well as the Windows UI Library. |

#### Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the Windows SDK.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Audio and video](/windows/desktop/audio-and-video) | Learn about features for integrating audio and video into your apps. |
| [Graphics and gaming](/windows/desktop/graphics-and-multimedia) | Learn about features involving graphics, gaming, and imaging. |
| [DirectX](/windows/desktop/getting-started-with-directx-graphics) | Learn about how to use DirectX APIs to create games and other high-performance multimedia apps using 2D and 3D graphics. |
| [Direct2D](/windows/desktop/direct2d/direct2d-portal) | Direct2D is a hardware-accelerated, immediate-mode, 2D graphics API that provides high performance and high-quality rendering for 2-D geometry, bitmaps, and text. |
| [Direct3D](/windows/desktop/direct3d) |  Direct3D is a low-level API for drawing primitives with the rendering pipeline, or for performing parallel operations with the compute shader.  |
| [GDI](/windows/desktop/gdi/windows-gdi) | The Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is a low-level graphics API that enables apps to use two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography. |
| [GDI+](/windows/desktop/gdiplus/-gdiplus-gdi-start) |  GDI+ improves on GDI by adding new features and by optimizing existing features. |

## .NET features

The .NET SDK also provides APIs related to audio, video, and camera scenarios for WPF and Windows Forms apps.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Graphics (WPF)](/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/graphics) | Learn about support for multimedia, vector graphics, animation, and content composition in WPF apps. |
| [Multimedia (WPF)](/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/multimedia-overview) | Learn about integrating audio and video into your WPF apps. |
| [Graphics and drawing (Windows Forms)](/dotnet/framework/winforms/advanced/graphics-and-drawing-in-windows-forms) | Learn how to create graphics, draw text, and manipulate graphical images in Windows Forms apps. |
| [SoundPlayer class (Windows Forms)](/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/soundplayer-class-overview) | Learn how to include sounds in your Windows Forms applications. |
