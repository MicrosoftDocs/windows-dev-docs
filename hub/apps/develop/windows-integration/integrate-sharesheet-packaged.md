# Integrate packaged apps with Windows Share

This article explains how to integrate packaged apps with the **Windows Share** feature. Apps that are packaged with [MSIX](/windows/msix/overview) have package identity and are ready to register as a **Share Target**. The Share feature allows users to share content from one app to another. A packaged app will register as a Share Target in order to receive and handle shared files within the app.

## What is Share Target?

Share Target is a feature that was introduced in Windows 8, and it allows an app to receive data from another app. Share Target works like a Clipboard but with dynamic content.

For the default share target registration to work with Win32 apps, the app needs to have a package identity and also handle the share arguments as [ShareTargetActivatedEventArgs](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.activation.sharetargetactivatedeventargs), which is a live object from the source app. It isn't a static memory content that is sent to the target app.

> [!NOTE]
> In a C++ app, use the [GetCurrentPackageFullName](/windows/win32/api/appmodel/nf-appmodel-getcurrentpackagefullname) API to check if the running app has package identity. The API returns the `APPMODEL_ERROR_NO_PACKAGE` error code if it isn't running with package identity.

## Prerequisites

To support `ShareTargetActivatedEventArgs`, the app must target Windows 10, version 2004 (build 10.0.19041.0) or later. This is the minimum target version for the feature.

## Register as a Share Target

There are two steps required to implement the Share contract in your app.

### Add a share target extension to appxmanifest

In Visual Studio's Solution Explorer, open the `package.appxmanifest` file of the Packaging project in your solution and add the share target extension.

```xml
<Extensions>
      <uap:Extension
          Category="windows.shareTarget">
        <uap:ShareTarget>
          <uap:SupportedFileTypes>
            <uap:SupportsAnyFileType />
          </uap:SupportedFileTypes>
          <uap:DataFormat>Bitmap</uap:DataFormat>
        </uap:ShareTarget>
      </uap:Extension>
</Extensions>
```

Add the supported data format that is supported by your application to the `DataFormat` configuration. In this case, the app supports sharing images, so the `DataFormat` is set to `Bitmap`.

### Fetch Share Event arguments

Starting in Windows 10, version 1809, packaged apps can call the [AppInstance.GetActivatedEventArgs](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.appinstance.getactivatedeventargs) method to retrieve certain kinds of app activation info during startup. For example, you can call this method to get information about app activation; whether it was triggered by opening a file, clicking an interactive toast, or using a registered protocol.

However, [ShareTargetActivatedEventArgs](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.activation.sharetargetactivatedeventargs) activation info is supported only on Windows 10, version 2004, and later. So, the application should target to devices with this specific minimum version.

To see a Windows App SDK implementation, see the `OnLaunched` method in the [Share Target sample app](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/blob/main/Samples/AppLifecycle/ShareTarget/WinUI-CS-ShareTargetSampleApp/WinUI-CS-ShareTargetSampleApp/App.xaml.cs).

For other packaged apps, in the `Main` method of the application, check for `AppInstance.GetActivatedEventArgs`.

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] cmdArgs)
{
    ...
    if (isRunningWithIdentity())
    {
        var activationArgs = AppInstance.GetActivatedEventArgs();
        if (activationArgs != null)
        {
            switch (activationArgs.Kind)
            {
                case ActivationKind.Launch:
                    HandleLaunch(activationArgs as LaunchActivatedEventArgs);
                    break;
                case ActivationKind.ToastNotification:
                    HandleToastNotification(activationArgs as ToastNotificationActivatedEventArgs);                                     
                    break;
                case ActivationKind.ShareTarget:
                    HandleShareAsync(activationArgs as ShareTargetActivatedEventArgs);
                    break;
                default:
                    HandleLaunch(null);
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See the [Photo Store Demo](https://github.com/microsoft/AppModelSamples/blob/master/Samples/SparsePackages/PhotoStoreDemo/StartUp.cs) app for a complete implementation.

## Handle shared files

The following code snippet shows how to handle shared files in a packaged app. The code snippet is part of the `HandleShareAsync` method that is called when the app is activated as a Share Target in the previous example.

```csharp
static async void HandleShareAsync(ShareTargetActivatedEventArgs args)
{
    ShareOperation shareOperation = args.ShareOperation;
    shareOperation.ReportStarted();

    if (shareOperation.Data.Contains( 
        Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.StandardDataFormats.StorageItems))
    {
        try
        {
            IReadOnlyList<IStorageItem> items = await shareOperation.Data.GetStorageItemsAsync();
            var file = (IStorageFile)items[0]; 
            string path = file.Path;
            var image = new ImageFile(path);
            image.AddToCache();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        }
    }
    shareOperation.ReportCompleted();

    // app launch code
}
```
