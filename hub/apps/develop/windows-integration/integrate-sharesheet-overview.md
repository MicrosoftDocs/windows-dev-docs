# App integration options with Windows Share

The Windows **Share Sheet** is a system-provided UI that enables users to share content from your app with other apps. The Share Sheet is available in the Windows shell and is accessible from any app that supports sharing. It provides a consistent and familiar experience for users, and it's a great way to increase the discoverability of your app.
