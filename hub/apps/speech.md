# Speech, voice, and conversation in Windows 10

![Speech hero image](images/hero-speech-composite-small.png)

Speech can be an effective, natural, and enjoyable way for people to interact with your Windows applications, complementing, or even replacing, traditional interaction experiences based on mouse, keyboard, touch, controller, or gestures.

Speech-based features such as speech recognition, dictation, speech synthesis (also known as text-to-speech or TTS), and conversational voice assistants (such as Cortana or Alexa) can provide accessible and inclusive user experiences that enable people to use your applications when other input devices might not suffice.

This page provides information on how the various Windows development frameworks provide speech recognition, speech synthesis, and conversation support for developers building Windows applications.
