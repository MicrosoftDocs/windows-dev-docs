# Code signing options for Windows app developers

If you publish your app as an **MSIX package** through the Microsoft Store, code signing is free and handled for you automatically — Microsoft re-signs the package after certification and you don't need to purchase or manage a certificate. If you publish as an **MSI/EXE installer** through the Store, you are responsible for Authenticode signing your installer before submission. Everything else in this article applies to apps distributed **outside the Microsoft Store**.

## Comparison at a glance

| Option | Cost | Availability | SmartScreen behavior | Store eligible | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Microsoft Store (MSIX)** — Store re-signs your package | Free | Worldwide | ✅ No warnings | ✅ Yes | Recommended for most new apps |
| **Microsoft Store (MSI/EXE installer)** — publisher must sign | Cert chaining to [Trusted Root Program CA](/security/trusted-root/participants-list) required (varies by CA) | Worldwide | ✅ No SmartScreen prompts during Store install (UAC may still appear) | ✅ Yes | Existing Win32 apps submitting via MSI/EXE installer path |
| **Azure Artifact Signing** (formerly Trusted Signing) | ~$9.99/month | Organizations: USA, Canada, EU, UK. Individuals: USA and Canada only | ⚠️ Reputation builds over time; initial warnings expected | ❌ No | Recommended for non-Store distribution |
| **OV certificate** (from a CA such as DigiCert, Sectigo) | $150–300/year | Worldwide | ⚠️ Same as Azure Artifact Signing — reputation builds over time | ❌ No | Developers who can't use Azure Artifact Signing, or who prefer traditional CAs |
| **EV certificate** | $400+/year | Worldwide | ⚠️ Same as OV since 2024 — no longer instant bypass | ❌ No | No longer recommended specifically for SmartScreen bypass |
| **Self-signed certificate** | Free | — | ❌ Blocks installation for public users | ❌ No | Dev/testing only, or enterprise with managed certificate trust |
| **No signature** | Free | — | ❌ Strong SmartScreen block; enterprises may block entirely | ❌ No | Not recommended for public distribution |

## Microsoft Store — MSIX submissions: no signing needed

Publishing an **MSIX package** through the Microsoft Store is the recommended distribution path for most Windows apps. Microsoft re-signs your package automatically, meaning users never see a SmartScreen warning and you never need to purchase or renew a certificate.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're submitting a **Win32 MSI or EXE installer** to the Store (rather than an MSIX package), Microsoft does not re-sign your installer. The installer and its PE files must be signed with a certificate chaining to a CA in the [Microsoft Trusted Root Program](/security/trusted-root/participants-list) — self-signed certificates are not accepted. See [App package requirements for MSI/EXE](/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/msi/app-package-requirements).

Create a free developer account at [storedeveloper.microsoft.com](https://storedeveloper.microsoft.com). After you register, use [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) to submit your app and manage its listing.

## Azure Artifact Signing (formerly Trusted Signing) — recommended for non-Store distribution

[Azure Artifact Signing (formerly Trusted Signing)](/azure/trusted-signing/) is Microsoft's recommended code signing service for developers who distribute apps outside the Store.

**Key details:**

- **Cost:** Approximately $9.99/month — significantly less than a traditional OV or EV certificate
- **Identity validation:** Microsoft validates your organization or individual identity before issuing certificates; plan for a few business days for verification
- **No hardware token required:** Signing integrates directly with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and others) — you don't need a physical USB token
- **SmartScreen behavior:** The same reputation-building model as OV certificates — new files will show a SmartScreen warning until they accumulate sufficient download history. Azure Artifact Signing does **not** provide instant SmartScreen trust.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Geographic limitation:** Azure Artifact Signing is available to organizations in the USA, Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. Individual developers are currently limited to the USA and Canada. If you are an individual developer outside those regions, see [OV certificates](#ov-certificates--traditional-ca-option) below.

## OV certificates — traditional CA option

Organization Validated (OV) certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA) such as DigiCert, Sectigo, or GlobalSign are a well-established option for code signing. They are the right choice when:

- You are located outside the USA, Canada, the EU, or the UK (organizations); or outside the USA or Canada (individual developers) and cannot use Azure Artifact Signing
- Your organization already has a relationship with a specific CA
- Your enterprise customers require a certificate from a particular CA

**Key details:**

- **Cost:** Typically $150–300/year depending on the CA and certificate tier
- **Identity validation:** The CA validates your organization's legal identity before issuing the certificate; allow several business days
- **HSM requirement:** As of June 2023, the CA/Browser Forum requires private keys for OV certificates to be stored on a hardware security module (HSM) or hardware token. Most CAs provide a compatible USB token or cloud HSM option.
- **SmartScreen behavior:** Equivalent to Azure Artifact Signing — reputation accumulates per file hash over time. Expect SmartScreen prompts for new files.

OV certificates are a proven option and are functionally equivalent to Azure Artifact Signing for SmartScreen purposes. If you are in the US or Canada (or an organization in the EU or UK), Azure Artifact Signing is typically more cost-effective and integrates more smoothly with automated build pipelines.

## EV certificates — no longer recommended for SmartScreen

Extended Validation (EV) certificates previously bypassed SmartScreen entirely on first download, making them the go-to choice for new apps with no reputation. **That behavior was removed in 2024.** EV-signed files now go through the same reputation-building process as OV certificates.

**What this means:**

- If you already have an EV certificate, it is still valid and functional for signing — keep using it until it expires
- EV certificates still require more rigorous identity validation, which may matter for enterprise procurement or other trust contexts
- Paying the EV premium ($400+/year) solely to avoid SmartScreen warnings is **no longer justified** — you will still see the same warnings as with an OV certificate

## Self-signed certificates — dev and testing only

A self-signed certificate is not trusted by Windows by default and will trigger a strong SmartScreen block for any user who hasn't manually installed the certificate as a trusted root. This makes self-signed certificates unsuitable for public distribution.

**Appropriate uses:**

- **Local development and testing** — you control the machine and can install the certificate manually
- **Enterprise internal distribution** — your IT department can deploy the certificate as a trusted root via Intune or Group Policy, allowing managed devices to install the app silently

## Open source: SignPath Foundation

If your project is open source, [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.io) offers free code signing for qualifying open-source projects. The program provides OV-level certificate signing through a managed pipeline. Check the SignPath Foundation website for eligibility requirements and the application process.
