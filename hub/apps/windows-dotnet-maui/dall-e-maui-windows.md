# Quickstart: Add DALL-E to your .NET MAUI Windows desktop app

In this quickstart, we'll demonstrate how to integrate DALL-E's image generation capabilities into your .NET MAUI Windows desktop app.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 17.8 or greater, with the .NET Multi-platform App UI workload installed. For more information, see [Installation](/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation).
- A functional .NET MAUI project with OpenAI integration into which this capability will be integrated. See *[Create a recommendation app with .NET MAUI and ChatGPT](tutorial-maui-ai.md)* - we'll demonstrate how to integrate DALL-E into the user interface from this how-to.
- An OpenAI API key from your [OpenAI developer dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) assigned to the `openAIKey` variable in your project.
- An [Azure.AI.OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI/) NuGet package installed in your project. If you've followed along with the .NET MAUI ChatGPT tutorial, you will have this dependency installed and configured.

<!-- Use this exact H2 -->
## What problem will we solve?

TODO: Write a brief description of the problem and how the product or service solves that problem. Include one or more diagrams when appropriate to show the solution architecture and/or the dataflow.

<!-- 

Present the demonstration in a series of H2s.

Each H2 should describe either what they'll do in the step or which part of the problem the step solves.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the demonstration
* The H2 title should describe either what they'll do in the step or which part of the problem the step solves
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>".
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context
* Provide a numbered list of procedural steps as applicable
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.

## How did we solve the problem?
TODO: End the demonstration with a few paragraphs of analysis to make it clear that the product or service was a good choice to solve the customer problem.

<!-- 8. Clean up resources ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: To avoid any costs associated with following the Quickstart procedure, a Clean up resources (H2) should come just before Next step or Related content (H2)

If there is a follow-on Quickstart that uses the same resources, make that option clear so that a reader doesn't need to recreate those resources. 

-->

<!-- Use this exact H2 -->
## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete <resources> with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu...
2. ...click Delete, type...and then click Delete

<!-- 9. Next step/Related content ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.

## Next step

TODO: Add your next step link(s)
