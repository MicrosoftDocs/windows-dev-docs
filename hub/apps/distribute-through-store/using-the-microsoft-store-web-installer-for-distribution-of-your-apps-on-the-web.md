# Using the Microsoft Store Web Installer for distribution of your apps on the web

## Microsoft Store Web Installer – Introduction & User flow

The Microsoft Store Web Installer is a tool to enable downloading and installing apps from websites such as apps.microsoft.com and the [Microsoft Store badge](https://apps.microsoft.com/badge) on developers’ websites.  

This system creates a stub *.exe-based installer for your application, securely generated by the Microsoft Store online service. This installer is downloaded to the users’ PC when a user clicks on the target button on a webpage, and is lightweight, containing only basic information needed and not the actual application binary.

When this file is activated, the executable then fetches the application binary in real-time from the Store service, and subsequently commences installation.  
Just like installing from the Store application, this installer manages pre-requisites and entitlements, as well as checks age eligibilities to ensure that the application is correctly installed.

Once the installation is done, the app is automatically launched so users can get started.  

## Feature availability
This functionality is available for the following content types hosted on the web:
* Free packaged MSIX content published on the Microsoft Store

The following content types are presently not supported:
* MSIXVC applications published on the Microsoft Store
* Win32 applications published on the Microsoft Store
* Paid content published on the Microsoft Store
* Subscriptions
* Movies & TV content


## How can I enable this feature for my application?

### **On apps.microsoft.com**  
You do not need to make any changes to enable the Store Web Installer for your application on apps.microsoft.com, as long as they are covered within the Feature availability section above and you’ve enabled launch mode=full, or launch mode=mini/pop-up in your calling URL parameters. 

The Store Web Installer is the default installer on apps.microsoft.com, and these parameters help you override the default installation system.

### **On your website**  
To switch to the Web installer on your website badge, follow the below steps:
* Navigate to https://apps.microsoft.com/badge, and enter the right data for your application.
* Make sure to set ‘Launch mode’ to ‘Direct’ to ensure the required code is generated for your application.
* Copy the code and insert the new badge within your website.

## Key notes for enterprise administrators
* If you’ve been using the [ApplicationManagement/RequirePrivateStoreOnly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/manage-access-to-private-store) MDM policy and the Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app Group policy to block domain joined devices from accessing the Store, do note that these settings are targeted towards disabling the Store application. This policy does not block installation or updates of applications within the Store.

* If you’d like to better control the types of apps that can be installed by domain-joined PCs, including apps from the Store, and from the Microsoft Store Web Installer, visit [AppLocker - Windows Security | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview). This policy can be used in combination with RequirePrivateStoreOnly, or independently. 

* If you’d like to specifically block installations from the Microsoft Store, including installations from the Microsoft Store Web Installer, use the [DisableStoreOriginatedApps policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-applicationmanagement#disablestoreoriginatedapps). This also blocks launch of pre-installed Store applications.
