# Install Vue.js on Windows Subsystem for Linux

A guide to help you set up a Vue.js development environment on Windows by installing the Vue.js web framework on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Learn more on the [Vue.js overview](./vue-overview.md) page.

Vue can be installed [directly on Windows](./vue-on-windows.md) or on WSL. We generally recommend installing on WSL if you are planning to interact with a NodeJS backend, want parity with a Linux production server, or plan to follow along with a tutorial that utilizes Bash commands. You may also want to consider [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) as an alternative to Vue.js.

## Prerequisites

- [Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](/windows/wsl/install-win10), including a Linux distribution (like Ubuntu) and make sure it is running in WSL 2 mode. You can check this by opening PowerShell and entering: `wsl -l -v`
- [Install Node.js on WSL 2](./nodejs-on-wsl.md): This includes a version manager, package manager, Visual Studio Code, and the Remote Development extension. The Node Package Manager (npm) is used to install Vue.js.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing a Linux distribution with WSL will create a directory for storing files: `\\wsl\Ubuntu-20.04` (substitute Ubuntu-20.04 with whatever Linux distribution you're using). To open this directory in Windows File Explorer, open your WSL command line, select your home directory using `cd ~`, then enter the command `explorer.exe .` Be careful not to install or store files that you will be working with on the mounted C drive (`/mnt/c/Users/yourname$`). Doing so will significantly slow down your install and build times.

## Install Vue.js

To install Vue.js on WSL:

1. Open a WSL command line (ie. Ubuntu).

2. Create a new project folder: `mkdir VueProjects` and enter that directory: `cd VueProjects`.

3. Install Vue.js using Node Package Manager (npm):

```bash
npm install vue
```

Check the version number you have installed by using the command: `vue --version`.

> [!NOTE]
> To install Vue.js using a CDN, rather than NPM, see the [Vue.js install docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CDN).

## Install Vue CLI

Vue CLI is a toolkit for working with Vue in your terminal / command line. It enables you to quickly scaffold a new project (vue create), prototype new ideas (vue serve), or manage projects using a graphical user interface (vue ui). Vue CLI is a globally installed npm package that handles some of the build complexities (like using Babel or Webpack) for you. *If you are not building a new single-page app, you may not need or want Vue CLI.*

To install Vue CLI, use npm. You must use the `-g` flag to globally install in order to upgrade (`vue upgrade --next`):

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

To learn more about additional plugins that can be added (such as linting or Apollo for integrating GraphQL), visit [Vue CLI plugins](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/#cli-plugins) in the Vue CLI docs.
