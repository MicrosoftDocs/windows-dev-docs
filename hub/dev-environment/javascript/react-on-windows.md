# Install React directly on Windows


This guide will walk through installing React directly on Windows using the [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) frontend tooling.

We recommend following these instructions if you are new to React and just interested in learning. If you are creating a single-page app (SPA) that you would like to use Bash commands or tools with and/or plan to deploy to a Linux server, we recommend that you [install with vite on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](./react-on-wsl.md).

For more general information about React, deciding between React (web apps), React Native (mobile apps), and React Native for Windows (desktop apps), see the [React overview](./react-overview.md).

## Create your React app

To install Create React App:

1. Open a terminal(Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Create a new project folder: `mkdir ReactProjects` and enter that directory: `cd ReactProjects`.
3. Install React using vite :

    ```powershell
    npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
    ```

4. Once installed, change directories into your new app ("my-react-app" or whatever you've chosen to call it): `cd my-react-app`, install the dependencies: `npm install` and then start your local development server: `npm run dev`

    This command will start up the Node.js server and launch a new browser window displaying your app. You can use **Ctrl + c** to stop running the React app in your command line.

> [!NOTE]
> Vite includes a frontend build pipeline using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), but doesn't handle backend logic or databases. If you are seeking to build a server-rendered website with React that uses a Node.js backend, we recommend [installing Next.js](./nextjs-on-wsl.md), rather than this Vite installation, which is intended more for single-page apps(SPAs). You also may want to consider [installing Gatsby](./gatsby-on-wsl.md) if you want to build a static content-oriented website.

6. When you're ready to deploy your web app to production, running `npm run build` to  create a build of your app in the "dist" folder. You can learn more in the [Deploying a Static Site](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html).
