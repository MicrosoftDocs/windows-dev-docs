# Set up your development environment on Windows

Windows invites you to code as you are. Use whatever coding language or framework you prefer - whether developing with tools on Windows or with Linux tools on the Windows Subsystem for Linux, this guide will help you get set up and install what you need to start coding, debugging, and accessing services to put your work into production.

## Run Windows and Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows developers to run a Linux operating system right alongside Windows. Both share the same hard drive (and can access each other’s files), the clipboard supports copy-and-paste between the two naturally, there's no need for dual-booting. WSL enables you to use BASH and will provide the kind of environment most familiar to Mac users.

Learn more in the [WSL docs](/windows/wsl).

You can also use Windows Terminal to open all of your favorite command line tools in the same window with multiple tabs, or in multiple panes, whether that's PowerShell, Windows Command Prompt, Ubuntu, Debian, Azure CLI, Oh-my-Zsh, Git Bash, or all of the above.

Learn more in the [Windows Terminal docs](/windows/terminal).
