## Rename Notification
This repo has recently been renamed from "windows-uwp" to "windows-dev-docs" to better represent the content source files contained.

If you have a copy of the repo on your local machine, you will need to update the associated URL following these steps:

1. `cd` to your local Git directory for the repo and find the remote name with the command: `git remote -v`

You will receive a response like the following example:
`origin  https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp.git (fetch)`
`origin  https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp.git (push)`

2. Set the new URL using the command:
`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-dev-docs.git`

*Alternatively, you can just delete your local copy of the repo and reclone it if you don't have any active work on the repo that you are concerned with losing.

Following the rename of this repo, the content team will also be working on renaming and restructuring the source file directories within the repo to align more closely with the structure of our live documentation. We are aiming to have this work complete by September 16, 2022.
