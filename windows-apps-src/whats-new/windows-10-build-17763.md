## Design & UI

Feature | Description
 :------ | :------
App icons and logos | The [app icons and logos page](../design/style/app-icons-and-logos.md) has been rewritten, and now shows the latest Visual Studio icon tools and provides information on adding images to your app's listing in the Microsoft Store.
Design landing page | The [updated Design landing page](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design) has an at-a-glance overview of UWP design areas and information on the latest additions to Fluent Design.
Fluent Design controls | The following new UI controls have been added, to enhance the Fluent Design System and the apparence of your apps: </br> * [CommandBarFlyout](../design/controls-and-patterns/command-bar-flyout.md) lets you show common user tasks in the context of an item on your UI canvas. </br> * [DropDownButton](../design/controls-and-patterns/buttons.md#create-a-drop-down-button), [SplitButton](../design/controls-and-patterns/buttons.md#create-a-split-button), and [ToggleSplitButton](../design/controls-and-patterns/buttons.md#create-a-toggle-split-button) provide button controls with specialized features to enhance your app's user interface. </br> * [MenuBar](../design/controls-and-patterns/menus.md) shows a set of multiple top-level menus in horizontal rows. </br> * [NavigationView](../design/controls-and-patterns/navigationview.md) now supports Top navigation, for cases in which your app has a smaller number of navigation options and requires more space for content. </br> * [TreeView](../design/controls-and-patterns/tree-view.md) has been enhanced to support data binding, item templates, and drag and drop.
Fluent Design updates | Visual updates and minor changes have been made to the following Fluent Design pages: </br> * [Alignment, padding, margins](../design/layout/alignment-margin-padding.md) </br> * [Color](../design/style/color.md) </br> * [Fluent Design for Windows apps](/windows/apps/fluent-design-system) </br> * [Introduction to app design](../design/basics/design-and-ui-intro.md) </br> * [Navigation basics](../design/basics/navigation-basics.md) </br> * [Responsive design techniques](../design/layout/responsive-design.md) </br> * [Screen sizes and breakpoints](../design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design.md) </br> * [Style overview](../design/style/index.md) </br> * [Writing style](../design/style/writing-style.md) </br> In addition, we've rewritten the following pages with all-new information on their content areas: </br> * [Icons](../design/style/icons.md) now provides practical recommendations for using icons and making them clickable. </br> * [Typography](../design/style/typography.md) consolidates information from similar articles, putting everything in a single place with updated guidance and illustrations.
Gaze input and interactions | [Gaze interactions](../design/input/gaze-interactions.md) allow your app to track a user's gaze, attention, and presence based on the location and movement of their eyes. This feature can be used as an assistive technology, and provides opportunities for gaming and other interactive scenarios where traditional input devices are not available.
Handwriting view | [HandwritingView](../design/controls-and-patterns/text-handwriting-view.md) is the new ink input surface for TextBox and RichEditBox.​ Users can tap a text control with their pen to expand the control into a writing surface. This guidance explains how to manage and customize the HandwritingView in your application.
Motion in Fluent Design | The use of motion in the Fluent Design System is evolving, built on the fundamentals of timing, easing, directionality, and gravity. Applying these fundamentals will help guide the user through your app, and connects them with their digital experience by reflecting the natural world. Learn more in these articles: </br> * [The Motion overview](../design/motion/index.md) has been updated to reflect these fundamentals. </br> * [Motion-in-practice](../design/motion/motion-in-practice.md) provides examples of how to apply these fundamentals within your app. It also contains information on Implicit Animations, which allow for easy interpolation between old and new value when a XAML element's property is changed. </br> * [Directionality and gravity](../design/motion/directionality-and-gravity.md) solidifies the user's mental model of your app. </br> * [Timing and easing](../design/motion/timing-and-easing.md) adds realism to the motion in your app. </br> * [XAML property animations](../design/motion/xaml-property-animations.md) allow you to directly animate properties of a XAML element, without needing to interact with the underlying composition Visual.
Page transitions | [Page transitions](../design/motion/page-transitions.md) navigate users between pages in an app. They help users understand where they are in the navigation hierarchy, and provide feedback about the relationship between pages.
Text scaling | The new [text scaling guidance](../design/input/text-scaling.md) explains how to update your applications to accommodate the new text scaling behaviors, which provide the ability for users to change relative font size across both the OS and individual applications. Instead of using a magnifier app (which typically just enlarges everything within an area of the screen and introduces its own usability issues), changing display resolution, or relying on DPI scaling (which resizes everything based on display and typical viewing distance), a user can quickly access a setting to resize just text, ranging from 100% (the default size) up to 225%.
Toolkits | The [Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator toolkits](../design/downloads/index.md) have been updated with new features. These design toolkits provide controls and layout templates for designing UWP apps.
UI commanding | Updates to the [UWP commanding infrastructure](../design/basics/commanding-basics.md) include a better encapsulation of a command object (behavior, label, icon, keyboard accelerators, access key, and description) and a standard set of common commands including cut, copy, paste, exit, etc., which eliminates the need to set these properties manually. </br> The new [XamlUICommand](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.input.xamluicommand) class provides a base class for defining the command behavior of an interactive UI element that performs an action when invoked. This is the parent class for [StandardUICommand](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.input.standarduicommand), which exposes a set of standard platform commands with pre-defined properties. 
Windows UI Library | The [Windows UI Library](/uwp/toolkits/winui/) is a set of NuGet packages that provide controls and other user interface elements for UWP apps. These packages are also compatible with earlier versions of Windows 10, so your app works even if your users don't have the latest OS version. </br> For more information on what's in the Windows UI Library, see [this list of API namespaces included in the NuGet package.](/uwp/api/overview/winui/)
