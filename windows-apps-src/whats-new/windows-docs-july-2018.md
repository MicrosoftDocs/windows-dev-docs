# What's New in the Windows Developer Docs in July 2018

The Windows Developer Documentation is constantly being updated with information on new features available to developers across the Windows platform. The following feature overviews, developer guidance, videos, and samples have been made available in the month of July.

[Install the tools and SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads#_blank) on Windows 10 and youâ€™re ready to either [create a new Universal Windows app](../get-started/create-uwp-apps.md) or explore how you can use your [existing app code on Windows](../porting/index.md).

## Features

### Progressive Web Apps on Windows

[Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/pwa) are simply web apps that are [progressively enhanced](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) with native app-like features on supporting platforms and browser engines, such as launch-from-homescreen installation, offline support, and push notifications. On Windows 10 with the Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) engine, PWAs enjoy the added advantage of running [independently of the browser window as UWP apps.](/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/windows-features)

Check out our PWA guides to:

* [Build a simple web app as a PWA](/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/get-started)
* [Enhance your PWA with the Windows Runtime](/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/windows-features)
* [Publish your PWA to the Microsoft Store](/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/microsoft-store)

### Notepad

Available in Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17713, [Notepad has been updated with many new features](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/07/11/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17713/). Zooming, wrap-around find/replace, and support for Unix/Linux (LF) and Mac (CR) line endings are now available to [Windows Insiders](https://insider.windows.com/). 

## Developer Guidance

### Design landing page

Check out the [updated Design landing page](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design) for an at-a-glance overview of UWP design areas, and information on the latest additions to Fluent Design.

### Design toolkits

The Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator toolkits have been updated with new features. These design toolkits provide controls and layout templates for designing UWP apps. [Check them out here.](../design/downloads/index.md)

### WebVR

We've added several new topics to the [WebVR documentation](/microsoft-edge/webvr/):

* [What is WebVR?](/microsoft-edge/webvr/what-is-webvr) Explains what WebVR is, why you should use it, and how to get started developing for it.

* [WebVR in Progressive Web Apps](/microsoft-edge/webvr/webvr-in-pwas): Learn how to add WebVR to a Progressive Web App (PWA).

* [WebVR in WebView](/microsoft-edge/webvr/webvr-in-webview): Learn how to add WebVR to a WebView control in a Windows 10 application.

* [WebVR demos](/microsoft-edge/webvr/demos): Check out some WebVR demos using Microsoft Edge and a Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset.

In addition, we've made some updates to existing pages:

* The table of contents is now better organized into four distinct top-level buckets: **Fundamentals**, **Development**, **Resources**, and **Demos**.

* [WebVR Developer's Guide (landing page)](/microsoft-edge/webvr/): Refreshed look and feel, with larger images and icons and new demo.

* [Using WebVR with Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/webvr/webvr-with-edge): Updated to include information about the Windows 10 April 2018 Update.

## Videos

### Get Started for Devs: Create and customize a form on Windows 10

Our [Get Started docs](../get-started/index.md) for Windows developers now provide hands-on experience with basic app development task. This video walks you through one of those topics, and covers the basics of creating a form UI in your app. [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgngKzq4hKI&feature=youtu.be) to see the code in action, then [check out the topic yourself.](../get-started/construct-form-learning-track.md)

### Enhance your Bot with Project Personality chat

Project Personality Chat lets you add a customizable persona to your chat bots. By integrating with the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK, you can add small-talk capabilities for a more conversational way to interact with the customers. [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C_uD8g2QKg&feature=youtu.be) to learn how to implement it, then [try out the interactive demo](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/personality-chat/) for a hands-on experience.

### One Dev Question

In the One Dev Question video series, longtime Microsoft developers cover a series of questions about Windows development, team culture, and history. Here's the latest questions that we've answered!

Raymond Chen:

* [Why did you apply to Microsoft?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL8ymamkEMU&feature=youtu.be)

Larry Osterman:

* [Why don't we let developers change the default audio device?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aNUoVfbnmg&feature=youtu.be)
* [Why are so many UWP functions async?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M724QIy1Mk&feature=youtu.be)

## Samples

### Photo Editor C++/WinRT

The Photo Editor sample app showcases development with the [C++/WinRT](../cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt.md) language projection. The app allows you to retrieve photos from the **Pictures** library, and then edit a elected image with associated photo effects.
