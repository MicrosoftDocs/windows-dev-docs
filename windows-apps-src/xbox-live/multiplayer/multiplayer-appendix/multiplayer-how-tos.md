| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subscribing for changes to a session requires the associated player to be active in the session. The connectionRequiredForActiveMembers field must also be set to true in the /constants/system/capabilities object for the session. This field is usually set in the session template. See [MPSD Session Templates](multiplayer-session-directory.md). |



To receive MPSD session change notifications, the title can follow the procedure below.

1.  Use the same **XboxLiveContext Class** object for all calls by the same user. Subscriptions are tied to the lifetime of this object. If there are multiple local users, use a separate **XboxLiveContext** object for each user.
2.  Implement event handlers for the **RealTimeActivityService.MultiplayerSessionChanged Event** and the **RealTimeActivityService.MultiplayerSubscriptionsLost Event**.
3.  If subscribing to changes for more than one user, add code to your **MultiplayerSessionChanged** event handler to avoid unnecessary work. Use the **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.Branch Property** and the **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.ChangeNumber Property**. Use of these properties allows tracking of the last change seen and ignoring of older changes.
4.  Call the **RealTimeActivityService.EnableMultiplayerSubscriptions Method** to allow subscriptions.
5.  Create a local session object and join that session as active.
6.  Make calls for each user to the **MultiplayerSession.SetSessionChangeSubscription Method**, passing the session change type for which to be notified.
7.  Now write the session to MPSD as described in **How to: Update a Multiplayer Session**.

The following flow chart illustrates how to start Multplayer by subscribing to the events described in this procedure.

### Parsing duplicate session change notifications

When there are multiple users subscribed to notifications for the same session, every change to that session will trigger a shoulder tap for each user. All but one of these will be duplicates. While it's still recommended that a title subscribe every user in a session to notifications, a title should ignore any changes that it's already been notified of; you can do this using the Branch and ChangeNumber properties.

To detect multiple shoulder taps, a title should:

-   For each **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.Branch Property** value seen, store the latest **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.ChangeNumber Property**.
-   If a shoulder tap has a higher **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.ChangeNumber Property** than the last seen for that **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.Branch Property**, process it and update the latest **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.ChangeNumber Property**.
-   If a shoulder tap does not have a higher **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.ChangeNumber Property** for that **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.Branch Property**, skip it. That change has already been handled.

| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.ChangeNumber Property** values need to be tracked by **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.Branch Property**, not by session. It's possible for the **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.Branch Property** value to change (and the **RealTimeActivityMultiplayerSessionChangeEventArgs.ChangeNumber Property** to reset) within the lifetime of a session. |

## Create an MPSD session


| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| By default, an MPSD session is created when the first member joins it. If your title logic expects the title to exist or not exist at join time, it can pass an appropriate write mode value to the write method during the session update. |



The title must do the following to create a new session:

1.  Create a new **XboxLiveContext Class** object. Your title creates this object once, stores it, and reuses it as required throughout the source code. Especially when working with session subscriptions, it is necessary to use exactly the same context.
2.  Create a new **MultiplayerSession Class** object to prepare all the session data that the MPSD needs to create a new session.
3.  Make required changes before writing the session to MPSD. For example, when joining a member to the session with a call to **MultiplayerSession.Join Method**, the client adds hidden local request data that tells MPSD to join upon the call to update the session.
4.  When finished making local changes, write them to MPSD as described in **How to: Update a Multiplayer Session**.
5.  Receive the new **MultiplayerSession** object from MPSD, with many fields filled in.
6.  Use the new session object going forward, and discard the old copy, which contains a hidden request to create a new session.

### Example

    void Example_MultiplayerService_CreateSession()
    {
      XboxLiveContext^ xboxLiveContext = ref new Microsoft::Xbox::Services::XboxLiveContext(User::Users->GetAt(0));

      // These from XDP web portal
      MultiplayerSessionReference^ multiplayerSessionReference = ref new MultiplayerSessionReference(
        "c83c597b-7377-4886-99e3-2b5818fa5e4f", // serviceConfigurationId
        "team-deathmatch", // sessionTemplateName
        "mySession" // sessionName
        );

      MultiplayerSession^ multiplayerSession = ref new MultiplayerSession(
        xboxLiveContext,
        multiplayerSessionReference
        );

      auto asyncOp = xboxLiveContext->MultiplayerService->WriteSessionAsync(
        multiplayerSession,
        MultiplayerSessionWriteMode::CreateNew
        );

      create_task(asyncOp)
      .then([](MultiplayerSession^ newMultiplayerSession)
      {
        // Throw away stale multiplayerSession, and use newMultiplayerSession from now on
      });
    }


## Set an arbiter for an MPSD session




The title uses the following procedure to set an arbiter for a session that has already been created.

| Note                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Device tokens for the members (potential hosts) are not available until the members have joined the session and included their secure device addresses. |

1.  Retrieve the device tokens for host candidates from the MPSD by using the **MultiplayerSession.Members Property**.

| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | If the session was created by SmartMatch matchmaking, your clients can use the host candidates available from MPSD through the **MultiplayerSession.HostCandidates Property**. |

2.  Select the required host from the list of host candidates.
3.  Call the **MultiplayerSession.SetHostDeviceToken Method** to set the device token in the local cache of the MPSD. If the call to set the host device token succeeds, the local device token replaces the host's token.
4.  If an HTTP/412 status code is received when trying to set the host device token, query the session data and see if the host device token is for the local console. If it is not for the local console, another console has been designated as the arbiter.

| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Your client should handle the HTTP/412 status code separately from other HTTP codes, since HTTP/412 does not indicate a standard failure. For more about the status code, see [Multiplayer Session Status Codes](multiplayer-session-status-codes.md). |

5.  Update the session in MPSD, as described in **How to: Update a Multiplayer Session**.

| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If you have no better algorithm, the client can implement a greedy algorithm in which each host candidate attempts to set itself as the host if nobody else has done it yet. For more information, see [Session Arbiter](mpsd-session-details.md). |

## Manage title activation

Xbox One fires the **CoreApplicationView.Activated Event** during protocol activation. In the context of the multiplayer API, this event is fired when a user accepts an invite or joins another user. These actions trigger an activation that the title must react to by bringing the joining user into game play with the target user.

| Note                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Your title should expect new activation arguments at any time and should never be coded against length. |

The title must perform the following main steps to handle title activation.

1.  Set up an event handler for the **CoreApplicationView.Activated Event**. This handler triggers every time protocol activation occurs, even if the title is already running.
2.  At title activation, begin a session and subscribe for session change notifications. See **How to: Subscribe for MPSD Session Change Notifications**.
3.  Join the user to the session as active. See **How to: Join an MPSD Session from a Title Activation**.
4.  Set the lobby session as the activity session, exposed through the profile UI. See **How to: Set the User's Current Activity**.
5.  Join the user to the game session as active. Now the user can connect to peers and enter game play or the lobby.

The following flow chart illustrates how to handle title activation.

![](../../images/multiplayer/Multiplayer_2015_OnActivation.png)

## Make the user joinable

To make the user joinable, the title must do the following:

1.  Create a session object, and modify the attributes as required.
2.  Join the user to the session as active. See **How to: Join an MPSD Session from a Title Activation**.
3.  Determine if the user has been designated as the session arbiter.
4.  If the user is not the arbiter, go to step 7.
5.  If the user is the arbiter, call the **MultiplayerSession.SetHostDeviceToken Method**.
6.  Attempt to write the session using a call to the **MultiplayerService.TryWriteSessionAsync Method**.
7.  Set the session as the active session. See **How to: Set the User's Current Activity**.

The following flow chart illustrates the steps to take to allow a user to be joined by other players during a game.

![](../../images/multiplayer/Multiplayer_2015_Become_Joinable.png)

## Send game invites

The title can enable a player to send game invites in the following ways:

-   Send the invites for the lobby session.
-   Send the invites using the generic Xbox platform invite UI with the game session reference.

To send game invites for a player, the title must do the following:

1.  Make the inviting game player joinable. See **How to: Make the User Joinable**.
2.  Determine if the invites are to be sent via the lobby session or using the invite UI.
3.  If using the lobby session, send the invites using a call to **MultiplayerService.SendInvitesAsync Method**. This method might require the building of an in-game UI roster using the **SystemUI.ShowPeoplePickerAsync Method** or the **PartyChat.GetPartyChatViewAsync Method**.
4.  If using the invite UI, call the **SystemUI.ShowSendGameInvitesAsync Method** to show the invite UI.
5.  Handle the **RealTimeActivityService.MultiplayerSessionChanged Event** for the local player after the remote player joins.
6.  For the remote player, implement title activation code. See **How to: Manage Title Activation**.

The following flow chart illustrates how to send invites.

![](../../images/multiplayer/Multiplayer_2015_Send_Invites.png)

## Join a game session from a lobby session

Gameplay sessions on Windows 10 devices must have the `userAuthorizationStyle` capability set to **true** if they are not large sessions. This means that the `joinRestriction` property cannot be "none", which means that the session can't be publicly joinable directly.

A common scenario is to create a lobby session to gather players, and then move those players into a gameplay session or matchmaking session. But if the gameplay session is not publicly joinable, then the game clients will not be able to join the gameplay session unless they meet the `joinRestriction` setting, which is too restrictive in most cases for this scenario.

The solution is use a transfer handle to link the lobby session and the game session.  The title can do this by doing the following:

1. When you create the game session, use the `multiplayer_service::set_transfer_handle(gameSessionRef, lobbySessionRef)` API to create a transfer handle that links the lobby session and the game session.
2. Store the transfer handle GUID in the lobby session instead of the game session's session reference.
3. When the title wants to move members from the lobby session to the game session, each client would use the transfer handle from the lobby session to join the game session by using the `multiplayer_service::write_session_by_handle(multiplayerSession, multiplayerSessionWriteMode, handleId)` API.
4. MPSD looks up the lobby session to verify that the members attempting to join the game session by using the transfer handle are also in the lobby session.
5. If the members are in the lobby session, they will be able to access the game session.

## Join an MPSD session from a title activation

When a user chooses to join a friend's activity or accept an invite using Xbox shell UI, the title is activated with parameters that indicate what session the user would like to join. The title must handle this activation and add the user to the corresponding session.

Here are the steps the title should follow:

1.  Implement an event handler for the **CoreApplicationView.Activated Event**. This event notifies of activations for the title.
2.  When the handler fires, examine the **IActivatedEventArgs.Kind Property**. If it is set to Protocol, cast the event arguments to **ProtocolActivatedEventArgs Class**.
3.  Examine the **ProtocolActivatedEventArgs** object. If the URI indicated in the **ProtocolActivatedEventArgs.Uri Property** matches either inviteHandleAccept (corresponding to an accepted invite) or activityHandleJoin (corresponding to a join via shell UI), parse the query string of the URI, which is formatted as a normal URI query string with key/value pairs, extracting the following fields:
    -   For an accepted invite:
        1.  handle
        2.  invitedXuid
        3.  senderXuid
    -   For a join:
        1.  handle
        2.  joinerXuid
        3.  joineeXuid

4.  Start the title's multiplayer code, which should include calling the **RealTimeActivityService.EnableMultiplayerSubscriptions Method**.
5.  Create a local **MultiplayerSession Class** object, using the **MultiplayerSession Constructor (XboxLiveContext)**.
6.  Call the **MultiplayerSession.Join Method (String, Boolean, Boolean)** to join the session. Use the following parameter settings so that the join is set as active:
    -   *memberCustomConstantsJson* = null
    -   *initializeRequested* = false
    -   *joinWithActiveStatus* = true

7.  Call the **MultiplayerSession.SetSessionChangeSubscription Method** to be shoulder-tapped when the session changes after joining.
8.  Call the **MultiplayerService.WriteSessionByHandleAsync Method**, using the handle acquired as described in step 3. Now the user is a member of the session, and can use data in the session to connect to the game.

## Set the user's current activity

The user's current activity is displayed in Xbox dashboard user experiences for the title. Activity for a user can be set through a session or through title activation. In the latter case, the user enters a session through matchmaking or by starting a game.

| Note                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Activity set through a session can be deleted with a call to the **MultiplayerService.ClearActivityAsync Method**. |

To set a session as the user's current activity, the title calls the **MultiplayerService.SetActivityAsync Method**, passing the session reference for the session.

To set the user's current activity through title activation, see **How to: Join an MPSD Session from a Title Activation**.

## Update an MPSD session

| Note                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| When your title updates an existing session using the multiplayer API, remember that it is working with a local copy, until it makes a call to write the session. |

To update an existing session, the title must:

1.  Make changes to the current session as required, for example, by calling the **MultiplayerSession.Leave Method**.
2.  When all changes are made, write the local changes to MPSD, using any of these methods:

    -   **MultiplayerService.WriteSessionAsync Method**
    -   **MultiplayerService.WriteSessionByHandleAsync Method**.
    -   **MultiplayerService.TryWriteSessionAsync Method**
    -   **MultiplayerService.TryWriteSessionByHandleAsync Method**

    Set the write mode to **SynchronizedUpdate** if writing to a shared portion that other titles can also modify. See [Synchronization of Session Updates](multiplayer-session-directory.md) for more information.

    The write method writes the join to the server and gets the latest session, from which to discover other session members and the secure device addresses (SDAs) of their consoles. For more information about establishing a network connection among these consoles, see **Introduction to Winsock on Xbox One**.

3.  Discard the old local session object, and use the newly retrieved session object so that future actions are based on the latest known session state.

## Leave an MPSD session

To allow a user to leave a session, the title must do the following.

1.  Call the **MultiplayerSession.Leave Method** for the game session.
2.  Update the game session in MPSD, as described in **How to: Update a Multiplayer Session**.
3.  If necessary, call **Leave** method for the lobby session, and update that session.
4.  If necessary for the lobby session, shut down the multiplayer API by unregistering the **RealTimeActivityService.MultiplayerSubscriptionsLost Event** and the **RealTimeActivityService.MultiplayerSessionChanged Event**.

The following flow chart illustrates how to leave the session and shut down.

![](../../images/multiplayer/Multiplayer_2015_Shut_Down.png)

## Fill open session slots during matchmaking

To fill open slots in a ticket session during matchmaking, the title must follow steps similar to the following:

1.  Access the latest session state for the ticket session created during matchmaking.
2.  Add available players for game play from the lobby session.
3.  Determine if the ticket session is full.
4.  If the session is full, continue game play.
5.  If the session is not yet full, create the match ticket as described in **How to: Create a Match Ticket**. Be sure to create the ticket with the *preserveSession* parameter set to Always.
6.  Continue with matchmaking. See [Using SmartMatch Matchmaking](using-smartmatch-matchmaking.md).

The following flow chart illustrates how to fill open session slots during matchmaking.

![](../../images/multiplayer/Multiplayer_2015_Fill_Open_Slots.png)

## Create a match ticket

To create a match ticket, the matchmaking scout must:

1.  Call the **MatchmakingService.CreateMatchTicketAsync Method**, passing in a reference to the ticket session. The method reads the ticket session from MPSD, and starts matchmaking for the users in the session. Internally the method calls the **POST (/serviceconfigs/{scid}/hoppers/{hoppername})**.
2.  Set the *preserveSession* parameter to Never if the matchmaking service is to match the members of the session into a new session or another existing session. Set the *preserveSession* parameter to Always to allow the title to reuse an existing game session as a ticket session to continue game play. The matchmaking service can then ensure that the submitted session is preserved and any matched players are added to that session.

3.  Use the **CreateMatchTicketResponse.EstimatedWaitTime Property** returned in the **CreateMatchTicketResponse Class** object to set user expectations of matchmaking time.
4.  Use the **CreateMatchTicketResponse.MatchTicketId Property** returned in the response object to cancel matchmaking for the session if needed, by deleting the ticket. Ticket deletion uses the **MatchmakingService.DeleteMatchTicketAsync Method**.

## Get match ticket status

Your title should do the following to retrieve match ticket status:

1.  Obtain the **MultiplayerSession Class** object for the ticket session.
2.  Use the **MultiplayerSession.MatchmakingServer Property** to access the **MatchmakingServer Class** object used in matchmaking.
3.  Check the **MatchmakingServer** object to determine the status of the matchmaking process, the typical wait time for the session, and the target session reference, if a match has been found.
