# Updated Flows For Multiplayer Game Invites

As a result of Xbox One beta feedback, the user experience flow for multiplayer game invites has been changed as of Xbox One Recovery Update 24, released on November 6, 2013. This is a change to the **user-experience (UX) only** and will not affect any behavior or functionality from the perspective of a game title. Title developers will not need to make any code changes.

## Summary of changes

-   The initial invitation toast has changed from “join my party” to “&lt;game title&gt; Let’s Play” and now has a button that allows users to launch the game and jump right into gameplay.

-   The Party app is not snapped by default when the user chooses the new “&lt;game title&gt; Let’s Play” option. This change is also made so that the user can jump right into gameplay.

-   A new toast has been added on the sender’s side that says “Adding \[*number*\] friends to the game”. This makes it clear that invites were sent out when a game session is associated with a user’s party.

The detailed user experience flows are described in the following examples. Each table shows an example flow for two users, David and Laura. These flows are shown in each column and occur in parallel. The <b style="background-color: #FFFF00">highlighted text</b> shows the adjustments that have been made from the prior UX flows.

## More about the Game Invite Sent toast

The **Game Invite Sent** toast will only appear the first time a game session is established with remote party members. Subsequent requests sent to remote party members will not generate this toast. This prevents the user from being spammed with repeated **Game Invite Sent** toasts if the title makes multiple calls to **PullReservedPlayersAsync**.

**Note** The best practice is to add all desired friends as Reserved, and then call **PullReservedPlayersAsync** only once.
