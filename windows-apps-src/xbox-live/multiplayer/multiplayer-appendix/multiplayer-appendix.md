# Multiplayer appendix

The multiplayer system in Xbox One enables game play and the assembly of game players into groups. The system is secure, easy to use, and flexible, allowing you not only to build simple features quickly, but also to build more complex features and plug in your own services.

> **Note**  
This article is for advanced API usage.  As a starting point, please take a look at the [Multiplayer Manager API](../multiplayer-manager.md) which significantly simplifies development.  Please let your DAM know if you find an unsupported scenario in the Multiplayer Manager.

The current version of the multiplayer system is 2015 Multiplayer. This version abstracts the "game party" concept and uses the multiplayer session directory (MPSD) to control game sessions.

> **Note**  
The previous version of the multiplayer system is 2014 Multiplayer. This version is based on the concept of the game party and participation in games through parties. This version is now deprecated, although source code for it is still provided with the XDK. The 2014 Multiplayer documentation is no longer included with the XDK. If you need this documentation, please use a 2014 release of the XDK.
