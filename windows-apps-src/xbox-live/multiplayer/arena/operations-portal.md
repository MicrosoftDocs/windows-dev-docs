# Xbox Arena Operations Portal



The Xbox Arena Operations Portal allows you to create and manage official tournaments for titles that are integrated with Xbox Arena. Official tournaments are run by the title and allow the developer a greater degree of customizability and manageability than user created tournaments.

This portal gives you the opportunity to build and run tournament experiences that are tailored for your title.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Xbox Arena Operations Portal is only available to managed partners and ID@Xbox members. It is not available to the Xbox Live Creators Program.

## Features

The Xbox Arena portal offers features beyond those of player-created tournaments. The following lists outline the additional features offered over player created tournaments:

#### Tournament creation features:

* Create invitation-only tournaments
* Specify which countries and regions can participate in the tournament
* Select customized art assets published via Partner Center
* Set a prizing flag (an icon that indicates to players that the tournament rewards a prize for winning) and the terms of use for prize tournaments
* Create customized game modes to be interpreted by the title or associated title services for setting up a match
* Create tournaments in developer sandboxes

#### Tournament management features:

* Pause and play active tournaments
* Override results
* View entire roster of tournament players and placement

## Get setup with the Xbox Arena Operations portal

In order to get setup, you'll need to reach out to your Microsoft account manager for more details about how to sign up as an operator on the portal. They can provide a link that a member of your team can use to sign in by using their Microsoft Account.

Once signed in, your Microsoft account manager will go through the steps to get an operator created on your behalf. From there, youâ€™ll be able to add additional users from your team once they go through the initial sign-in process. You can also set individualized access for each member of your team via the roles management section of the portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You cannot create shared accounts across multiple users, each user must login with their own individual credentials.
