# Participant user scenarios

Tournaments occupy an interesting space in the gaming world: they simultaneously celebrate both collaborative and competitive gameplay, rather than competition only. The blend of teamwork and combat has really gotten its focus and biggest push from the rise of professional tournaments.

Xbox Arena and Xbox titles are providing more ways to strike a balance between collaboration and competition going forward. The scenarios presented in this section demonstrate how these types of experiences appeal to a range of gamer motivations.

Xbox Arena, Xbox Social features, and Arena APIs do more than just meet the need of tournament progression. When combined, they lead to an exciting collaborative and competitive experience.

For example:

* Promoting tournaments inside a game raises visibility to existing fans who are looking for inspiration and creative challenges.

* Clubs and team Looking for Group (LFG) posts bring communities together and result in opportunities to collaborate and learn from other skilled creators.

* Game DVR, screenshots, and Mixer broadcasting expose the gameplay or winning results to participants and spectators. This will meet the needs of gamers who are looking for inspiration and new ways to develop their skills. These images can be surfaced at a Results stage, along with tournament results, or through the Watch section in the Arena UI.

* Leaderboards, stats, and player profiles now include past and present tournament results, celebrating a participant’s competitive status.

## Motivation type: Immersion

* To become immersed in a game or a game’s story.

* To explore new virtual worlds.

* To have my senses stimulated by any component of a game (including art, sound, design, gameplay, etc.).

* To progress in game components (for example, gameplay mechanics, skills, personalization, story) that deepen my connection to the game.
