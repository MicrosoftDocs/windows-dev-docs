# Multiplayer session browse

Multiplayer session browse is a new feature introduced in November 2016 that enables a title to query for a list of open multiplayer game sessions that meet the specified criteria.

## What is session browse?

In a session browse scenario, a player in a game is able to retrieve a list of joinable game sessions. Each session entry in this list contains some additional metadata about the game, which a player can use to help them select which session to join.  They can also filter the list of sessions based on the metadata. Once the player sees a game session that appeals to them, they can join the session.

A player can also create a new game session, and use session browse to recruit additional players instead of relying on matchmaking.

Session browse differs from traditional matchmaking scenarios in that the player self-selects which game session they want to join, while in matchmaking, the player typically clicks a "find a game" button that attempts to automatically place the player in an appropriate game session. While session browse is a manual and slower process that may not always select the objectively best game, it provides more control to the player and can be perceived as the subjectively better game pick.

It is common to include both session browse and matchmaking scenarios in games. Typically matchmaking is used for commonly played game modes, while session browse is used for custom games.

**Example:** John may be interested in playing a hero battle arena style multiplayer game, but wants to play a game where all players select their hero randomly. He can retrieve a list of open game sessions and find the ones that include "random heroes" in their description, or if the game UI allows it, he can select the "random hero" game mode and retrieve only the sessions that are tagged to indicate that they are "RandomHero" games.

When he finds a game that he likes, he joins the game. When enough people have joined the session, the host of the game session can start the game.

### Roles

A game in session browse may want to recruit players for specific roles. For example, a player may want to create a game session that specifies that the session contains no more than 5 assault classes, but must contain at least 2 healer roles, and at least 1 tank role.

When another player applies for the session, they can pre-select their role, and the service will not allow them to join the session if there are no open slots for the role they have selected.

Another example would be if a player wants to reserve 2 slots for their friends to join, the game can specify a "friends" role, and only players that are friends with the session host can fill the 2 slots dedicated to the "friends" role.

For more information about roles, see [multiplayer roles](multiplayer-roles.md).



## How does session browse work?

Session browse works primarily on the use of search handles. A search handle is a packet of data that contains a reference to the session, as well as additional metadata about the session, namely search attributes.

When a title creates a new game session that is eligible for session browse, it creates a search handle for the session. The search handle is stored in the Multiplayer Service Directory (MPSD), which maintains the search handles for the title.

When a title needs to retrieve a list of sessions, the title can send a search query to MPSD, which will return a list of search handles that meet the search criteria. The title can then use the list of sessions to display a list of joinable games to the player.

When a session is full, or otherwise cannot be joined, a title can remove the search handle from MPSD so that the session will no longer show up in session browse queries.

>[!NOTE]
> Search handles are intended to be used when displaying a list of sessions to be presented to a user. Using search handles for background matchmaking is not valid, and instead consider using [SmartMatch](multiplayer-manager/play-multiplayer-with-matchmaking.md)

## Set up a session for session browse

In order to use search handles for a session, the session must have the following capabilities set to true:

* `searchable`
* `userAuthorizationStyle`

>[!NOTE]
> The `userAuthorizationStyle` capability is only required for UWP games, but we recommend implementing them for all Xbox Live games, including XDK games, as it ensures future portability.

>[!NOTE]
> Setting the `userAuthorizationStyle` capability defaults the `readRestriction` and `joinRestriction` of the session to `local` instead of `none`. This means that titles must use search handles or transfer handles to join a game session.

You can set these capabilities in the session template when you configure your Xbox Live services.

For session browse, you should only create search handles on sessions that will be used for actual gameplay, not for lobby sessions.

## What does it mean to be an owner of a session?

While many game session types, such as SmartMatch or a friends only game, do not require an owner, for session browse sessions you may wish to have an owner. 

Having an owner-managed session has some benefits for the owner. Owners can remove other members from the session, or change the ownership status of other members.

In order to use owners for a session, the session must have the following capabilities set to true:

* `hasOwners`

If an owner of a session has an Xbox Live member blocked, that member cannot join the session.

When using [multiplayer roles](multiplayer-roles.md), you can set it so only owners can assign roles to users.

If all owners leave a session, then the service takes action on the session based the `ownershipPolicy.migration` policy that is defined for the session. If the policy is "oldest", then the player that has been in the session the longest is set to be the new owner. If the policy is "endsession" (the default if not supplied), then the service ends the session and removes all remaining players from the session.


## Search handles

A search handle is stored in MSPD as a JSON structure. In addition to containing a reference to the session, search handles also contain additional metadata for searches, known as search attributes.

A session can only have one search handle created for it at any time.

To create a search handle for a session in by using the Xbox Live APIs, you first create a `multiplayer::multiplayer_search_handle_request` object, and then pass that object to the `multiplayer::multiplayer_service::set_search_handle()` method.

### Search attributes

Search attributes consists of the following components:

`tags` - Tags are string descriptors that people can use to categorize a game session, similar to a hashtag. Tags must start with a letter, cannot contain spaces, and must be less than 100 characters.
Example tags: "ProRankOnly", "norocketlaunchers", "cityMaps".

`strings` - Strings are text variables, and the string names must start with a letter, cannot contain spaces, and must be less than 100 characters.

Example string metadata: "Weapons"="knives+pistols+rifles", "MapName"="UrbanCityAssault", "description"="Fun casual game, new people welcome."

`numbers` - Numbers are numeric variables, and the number names must start with a letter, cannot contain spaces, and must be less than 100 characters. The Xbox Live APIs retrieve number values as type float.

Example number metadata: "MinLevel" = 25, "MaxRank" = 10.

>**Note:** The letter casing of tags and string values is preserved in the service, but you must use the tolower() function when you query for tags. This means that tags and string values are currently all treated as lower case, even if they contain upper case characters.

In the Xbox Live APIs, you can set the search attributes by using the `set_tags()`, `set_stringsmetadata()`, and `set_numbers_metadata()` methods of a `multiplayer_search_handle_request` object.


### Additional details

When you retrieve a search handle, the results also include additional useful data about the session, such as if the session is closed, are there any join restrictions on the session, etc.

In the Xbox Live APIs, these details, along with the search attributes, are included in the `multiplayer_search_handle_details` that are returned after a search query.

### Remove a search handle

When you want to remove a session from session browse, such as when the session is full, or if the session is closed, you can delete the search handle.

In the Xbox Live APIs, you can use the `multiplayer_service::clear_search_handle()` method to remove a search handle.

### Example: Create a search handle with metadata

The following code shows how to create a search handle for a session by using the C++ Xbox Live multiplayer APIs.

```cpp
auto searchHandleReq = multiplayer_search_handle_request(sessionBrowseRef);

searchHandleReq.set_tags(std::vector<string_t> val);
searchHandleReq.set_numbers_metadata(std::unordered_map<string_t, double> metadata);
searchHandleReq.set_strings_metadata(std::unordered_map<string_t, string_t> metadata);

auto result = xboxLiveContext->multiplayer_service().set_search_handle(searchHandleReq)
.then([](xbox_live_result<void> result)
{
  if (result.err())
  {
    // handle error
  }
});
```


## Create a search query for sessions

When retrieving a list of search handles, you can use a search query to restrict the results to the sessions that meet specific criteria.

The search query syntax is an  [OData](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata02/os/complete/part2-url-conventions/odata-v4.0-errata02-os-part2-url-conventions-complete.html#_Toc406398092) style syntax, with only the following operators supported:

 Operator | Description
 --- | ---
 eq | equals
 ne | not equal to
 gt | greater than
 ge | greater than or equal
 lt | less than
 le | less than or equal
 and | logical AND
 or | logical OR (see note below)

You can also use lambda expressions and the `tolower` canonical function. No other OData functions are supported currently.

When searching for tags or string values, you must use the 'tolower' function in the search query, as the service only currently supports searching for lower-case strings.

The Xbox Live service only returns the first 100 results that match the search query. Your game should allow players to refine their search query if the results are too broad.

>[!NOTE]
>  Logical ORs are supported in filter string queries; however only one OR is allowed and it must be at the root of your query. You cannot have multiple ORs in your query, nor can you create a query that would result in OR not being at the top most level of the query structure.

### Search handle query examples

In a restful call, "Filter" is where you would specify an OData Filter language string that will be run in your query against all search handles.  
In the multiplayer 2015 APIs, you can specify the search filter string in the *searchFilter* parameter of the `multiplayer_service.get_search_handles()` method.  

Currently, the following filter scenarios are supported:

 Filter by | Search filter string
 --- | ---
 A single member xuid '1234566’ | "session/memberXuids/any(d:d eq '1234566')"
 A single owner xuid '1234566’ | "session/ownerXuids/any(d:d eq '1234566')"
 A string 'forzacarclass' equal to 'classb‘ | "tolower(strings/forzacarclass) eq 'classb'"
 A number 'forzaskill' equal to 6 | "numbers/forzaskill eq 6"
 A number 'halokdratio' greater than 1.5 | "numbers/halokdratio gt 1.5"
 A tag 'coolpeopleonly' | "tags/any(d:tolower(d) eq 'coolpeopleonly')"
 Sessions that do not contain the tag 'cursingallowed' | "tags/any(d:tolower(d) ne 'cursingallowed')"
 Sessions that do not contain a number 'rank' that is equal to 0 | "numbers/rank ne 0"
 Sessions that do not contain a string 'forzacarclass' that is equal to 'classa' | "tolower(strings/forzacarclass) ne 'classa'"
 A tag 'coolpeopleonly' and a number 'halokdratio' equal to 7.5 | "tags/any(d:tolower(d) eq 'coolpeopleonly') eq true and numbers/halokdratio eq 7.5"
 A number 'halodkratio' greater than or equal to 1.5, a number 'rank' less than 60, and a number 'customnumbervalue' less than or equal to 5 | "numbers/halokdratio ge 1.5 and numbers/rank lt 60 and numbers/customnumbervalue le 5"
 An achievement id '123456' | "achievementIds/any(d:d eq '123456')"
 The language code 'en' | "language eq 'en'"
 Scheduled time, returns all scheduled times less than or equal to the specified time | "session/scheduledTime le '2009-06-15T13:45:30.0900000Z'"
 Posted time, returns all posted times less than the specified time | "session/postedTime lt '2009-06-15T13:45:30.0900000Z'"
 Session registration state | "session/registrationState eq 'registered'"
 Where the number of session members is equal to 5 | "session/membersCount eq 5"
 Where the session member target count is greater than 1 | "session/targetMembersCount gt 1"
 Where the max count of session members is less than 3 | "session/maxMembersCount lt 3"
 Where the difference between the session member target count and the number of session members is less than or equal to 5 | "session/targetMembersCountRemaining le 5"
 Where the difference between the max count of session members and the number of session members is greater than 2 | "session/maxMembersCountRemaining gt 2"
 Where the difference between the session member target count and the number of session members is less than or equal to 15.</br> If the role does not have a target specified, then this query filters against the difference between the max count of session members and the number of session members. | "session/needs le 15"
 Role "confirmed" of the role type "lfg" where the number of members with that role is equal to 5 | "session/roles/lfg/confirmed/count eq 5"
 Role "confirmed" of the role type "lfg" where the target of that role is greater than 1.</br> If the role does not have a target specified, then the max of the role is used instead. | "session/roles/lfg/confirmed/target gt 1"
 Role "confirmed" of the role type "lfg" where the difference between the target of the role and the number of members with that role is less than or equal to 15.</br> If the role does not have a target specified, then this query filters against the difference between the max of the role and the number of members with that role. | "session/roles/lfg/confirmed/needs le 15"
 All search handles that point to a session containing a particular keyword | "session/keywords/any(d:tolower(d) eq 'level2')"
 All search handles that point to a session belonging to a particular scid | "session/scid eq '151512315'"
 All search handles that point to a session that uses a particular template name | "session/templateName eq 'mytemplate1'"
 All search handles that have the tag 'elite' or have a number 'guns' greater than 15 and string 'clan' equal to 'purple' | "tags/any(a:tolower(a) eq 'elite') or number/guns gt 15 and string/clan eq 'purple'"

### Refreshing search results

 Your game should avoid automatically refreshing a list of sessions, but instead provide UI that allows a player to manually refresh the list (possibly after refining the search criteria to better filter the results).

 If a player attempts to join a session, but that session is full or closed, then your game should refresh the search results as well.

 Too many search refreshes can lead to service throttling, so your title should limit the rate at which the query can be refreshed.

 To reduce service call volume, search handles include custom session properties which can be used to store and query rapidly changing session attributes. Such attributes should not be stored in search attributes.

### Example: query for search handles

 The following code shows how to query for search handles. The API returns a collection of `multiplayer_search_handle_details` objects that represent all the search handles that match the query.

```cpp
 auto result = multiplayer_service().get_search_handles(scid, template, orderBy, orderAscending, searchFilter)
 .then([](xbox_live_result<std::vector<multiplayer_search_handle_details>> result)
 {
   if (result.err())
   {
      // handle error
   }
   else
   {
      // parse result.payload
   }
 });

 /* Payload element properties

 multiplayer_search_handle_details
 {
   string_t& handle_id();
   multiplayer_session_reference& session_reference();
   std::vector<string_t>& session_owner_xbox_user_ids();
   std::vector<string_t>& tags();
   std::unordered_map<string_t, double>& numbers_metadata();
   std::unordered_map<string_t, string_t>& strings_metadata();
   std::unordered_map<string_t, multiplayer_role_type>& role_types();
 }
 */
```

## Join a session by using a search handle

Once you have retrieved a search handle for a session that you want to join, the title should use  `MultiplayerService::WriteSessionByHandleAsync()` or `multiplayer_service::write_session_by_handle()` to add themselves to the session.

> [!NOTE]
> The `WriteSessionAsync()` and `write_session()` methods cannot be used to join a session browse session.

The following code demonstrates how to join a session after retrieving a search handle.

```cpp
void Sample::BrowseSearchHandles()
{
    auto context = m_liveResources->GetLiveContext();
    context->multiplayer_service().get_search_handles(...)
    .then([this](xbox_live_result<std::vector<multiplayer_search_handle_details>> searchHandles)
    {
        if (searchHandles.err())
        {
            LogErrorFormat( L"BrowseSearchHandles failed: %S\n", searchHandles.err_message().c_str() );
        }
        else
        {
            m_searchHandles = searchHandles.payload();

            // Join the game session

            auto handleId = m_searchHandles.at(0).handle_id();
            auto sessionRef = multiplayer_session_reference(m_searchHandles.at(0).session_reference());
            auto gameSession = std::make_shared<multiplayer_session>(m_liveResources->GetLiveContext()->xbox_live_user_id(), sessionRef);
            gameSession->join(web::json::value::null(), false, false, false);

            context->multiplayer_service().write_session_by_handle(gameSession, multiplayer_session_write_mode::update_existing, handleId)
            .then([this, sessionRef](xbox_live_result<std::shared_ptr<multiplayer_session>> writeResult)
            {
                if (!writeResult.err())
                {
                    // Join the game session via MPM
                    m_multiplayerManager->join_game(sessionRef.session_name(), sessionRef.session_template_name());
                }
            });
        }
    });
}
```
