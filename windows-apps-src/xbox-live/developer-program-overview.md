# Developer program overview

If you would like to develop Xbox Live enabled titles, there are several options available to you. Each offers varying levels of time investment on your part, features available to you, and support options.

## Xbox Live Creators Program

The Xbox Live Creators Program is a good starting point for Xbox Live if you are looking to familiarize yourself with Xbox Live development. No approval process from Microsoft is required to join this program, and there are minimal certification and publishing requirements. 

The Xbox Live Creators Program only supports the creation of titles for the [Universal Windows Platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) (UWP).  These titles created as UWP games run on Windows 10 PCs and on Xbox One consoles.  For more details about running UWP games on Xbox One, see [UWP on Xbox One](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/index).  

On Xbox One, which offers gamers a curated store experience, games published through the Xbox Live Creators Program will be sold in the new Creators Collection section of the Store. This offers a balance between ensuring an open platform where anyone can develop and ship a game, and a curated store experience consoles gamers have come to know and expect. On Windows 10, your title will be published among all of the other Xbox Live games in the Windows Store.

### Publishing and Certification
You must be enrolled in the [Dev Center developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/store/register) to release a game as part of the Xbox Live Creators Program. There are two sets of requirements that your game must follow:

1. Integrate Xbox Live Sign-In and display the user identity (Gamertag, Gamerpic, etc.). All other Xbox Live services are optional.
2. Follow to the standard [Windows Store Policies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn764944.aspx).

### Supported Xbox Live Services
Titles enabled under the Xbox Live Creators Program can use Leaderboards, Featured Stats, Title Storage, Connected Storage, and a restricted set of social features. Achievements, online multiplayer, and many social features are **not** supported for titles in the Xbox Live Creators Program. 

For a full list of supported services, see the [Feature Table](#feature-table).

### Support and Feedback
Any questions you might have can be answered on the [MSDN Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=xboxlivedev).  You can also ask programming related questions to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xbox-live) using the "xbox-live" tag.  The Xbox Live team will be engaged with the community and be continually improving our APIs, tools, and documentation based on the feedback received there.

For developers in the Xbox Live Creators Program, you can submit a new idea or vote on existing idea at our [Xbox Live Creators Program User Voice](https://aka.ms/xblcpuv)

## ID@Xbox

The Xbox Live Creators Program is great for lots of games and developers. But if youâ€™d like to access the full Xbox Live stack, including online multiplayer, achievements and Gamerscore, or you want to access the full power of the Xbox One family of devices using hardware dev kits, the [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/id) program is for you.

Games in the ID@Xbox program must be concept approved and go through full certification on Xbox One and Windows 10, which is a greater time commitment on your part.
ID@Xbox titles get placement in the primary section of the Store, versus the Creators Collection, which may allow for greater exposure to customers.

Developers in the ID@Xbox program also gain access to developer support and promotional assistance from Microsoft, as well as the full complement of private whitepapers and developer technical forums. You can continue to use [MSDN Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=xboxlivedev) or ask programming related questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xbox-live) using the "xbox-live" tag if you like.

## Microsoft Partners

Developers working with a game publisher that is a Microsoft Partner have access to the full set of Xbox Live features and dedicated Microsoft representatives to assist in your development, certification, and release process.
