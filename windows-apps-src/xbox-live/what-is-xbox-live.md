# What is Xbox Live?

Xbox Live is a premier gaming network that connects millions of gamers across the world. You can add Xbox Live to your Windows 10 or Xbox One game in order to take advantage of the Xbox Live features and services.

Here are some reasons to add Xbox Live to your game:

- Xbox Live unites gamers across Xbox One and Windows 10, so gamers can play with their friends and connect with a massive community of players.
- Xbox Live lets players build a gaming legacy by unlocking achievements, sharing epic game clips, amassing Gamerscore, and perfecting their avatar.
- Xbox Live lets gamers play and pick up where they left off on another Xbox One or PC, bringing all their saves from another device.
- With over 1 billion multiplayer matches played each month, Xbox Live is built for performance, speed and reliability.
- With cross-device multiplayer, gamers can play with your friends regardless of whether they play on Xbox One or Windows 10 PC.

## How Xbox Live works

On a technical level, Xbox Live is a collection of microservices that expose Xbox Live features such as profile, friends and presence, stats, leaderboards, achievements, multiplayer, and matchmaking using REST endpoints and secure websockets that are accessible from a set of client-side APIs designed for game developers.
