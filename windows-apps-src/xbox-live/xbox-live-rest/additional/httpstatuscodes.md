# Standard HTTP status codes
 
The Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) standard describes a number of status codes that are returned by the server in response to a client request. Xbox Live Services methods return HTTP protocol-compliant status codes to describe the status of the request.
 
Here is a list of status codes returned by Xbox Live Services, and their typical meanings.
