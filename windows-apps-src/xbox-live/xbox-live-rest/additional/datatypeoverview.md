# Data Type Overview
 
Xbox Live Services uses a variety of data types related to identity and authentication. This topic provides an overview of those types.
 
| Type| Description| 
| --- | --- | 
| gamertag| A unique, human-readable screen name for the user.| 
| Player| A JSON object containing the user's XUID and gamertag, as well the player's index in the session (or "seat"), whether the player is still participating in the session, and a small blob of custom data.| 
| profile| Information about the user accessed through profile URI addresses and HTTP methods, usually the user's UserSettings, but also possibly including gamercard, gamertag, XUID, and so on.| 
| setting| One of the title-specific settings in a UserSettings object.| 
| UserClaims| A simple JSON object containing the user's XUID and gamertag.| 
| UserSettings| A JSON object containing a collection of title-specific settings or preferences for the current authenticated user. UserSettings can contain arbitrary data, possibly related to in-game activity.| 
| XUID| The user's Xbox User ID, a unique unsigned long integer. Not meant to be human-readable.|
