# EDS Query Refiners
 
<a id="ID4EO"></a>

  
 
The following parameters can be used to refine an Entertainment Discovery Services (EDS) query to a more targeted set of items. None of these parameters are required in any API, but they're accepted in any API that accepts query refiners.
 
The parameter names can be passed in as values into any "queryRefiners" parameter. This will then return the number of items that would be returned if the request were repeated with the query refiner applied, broken down by each value of the query refiner.
 
Here's how this might work in practice:
 
   * A call to the browse API is made, including the parameter "queryRefiners=genre".
   * The API returns eight games. In addition to the items, a list of each genre that has items will be returned, along with how many items belong to that genre. For a game, this might be "Shooter: 3, Puzzle: 5".
   * A second query is made. It's identical to the first, except that "genre=Shooter" is added.
   * The response now contains only three games, all of which belong to the "Shooter" category.
