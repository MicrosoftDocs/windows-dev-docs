# MultiplayerSession (JSON)
A JSON object representing the **MultiplayerSession**. 
<a id="ID4EQ"></a>

  
 
The MultiplayerSession JSON object has the following specification.
 
| Member| Type| Description| 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| constants| object| Read-only settings that are merged with the session template to produce the constants for the session. | 
| properties | object | Changes to be merged into the session properties.| 
| members.me | object| Constants and properties that work much like their top-level counterparts. Any PUT method requires the user to be a member of the session, and adds the user if necessary. If "me" is specified as null, the member making the request is removed from the session. | 
| members | object| Other objects that represent users to add to the session, keyed by a zero-based index. The number of members in a request always starts with 0, even if the session already contains members. Members are added to the session in the order in which they appear in the request. Member properties can only be set by the user to whom they belong. | 
| servers | object| Values indicating updates and additions to the session's set of associated server participants. If a server is specified as null, that server entry is removed from the session. |
