# TitleRecord (JSON)
Information about a title, including its name and a last-modified timestamp. 
<a id="ID4EN"></a>

 
## TitleRecord
 
A TitleRecord must contain a DeviceRecord or a LastSeenRecord, but may not contain both.
 
The TitleRecord object has the following specification.
 
| Member| Type| Description| 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| id| 32-bit unsigned integer| TitleId of the record.| 
| name| string| Localized name of the title.| 
| activity| [ActivityRecord](json-activityrecord.md)| The activity of the user in the title. Only returned if depth is "all".| 
| lastModified| DateTime| UTC timestamp when the record was last updated.| 
| placement| string| The location of the app within the user interface. Possibilities include "fill", "full", "snapped", or "background". The default is "full" for devices without the ability to place apps.| 
| state| string| The state of the title. Can be "active" or "inactive" (the default). The title sets the state based on its own criteria for activity and inactivity.|
