### Feedback Types

The "Sent by" column indicates who can submit the feedback.

   * "User" means it can be submitted by the console using an XToken for Auth, therefore the API can accept **SubmitFeedback**.
   * "Partner" means it can be submitted by a Partner using a Claims Cert, therefore the API can accept **SubmitBatchFeedback**.
   * "Privacy" means only the SLS Privacy service can send the feedback.
   * "None" means the feedback is generated internally by the SLS reputation service for auditing and cannot be sent by any caller.
