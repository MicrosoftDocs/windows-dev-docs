## DeviceEndpoint
 
The DeviceEndpoint object has the following specification.
 
| Member| Type| Description| 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| deviceName| string| Optional. A friendly name for the device, if applicable. Currently this value is not used.| 
| endpointUri| string| Required. The URL that the client platform (Windows or Windows Phone) has obtained from its push notification service (WNS or MPNS).| 
| locale| string| Required. The desired language of notifications sent to this endpoint. Can be a list of comma-separated values in preference order. Example: "de-DE, en-US, en".| 
| platform| string| Optional. Currently supported values are "WindowsPhone" and "Windows". If not specified, it is derived from the Device token.| 
| platformVersion| string| Optional. The format of this string is particular to each platform. Currently this value is not used.| 
| systemId| GUID| Required. Unique identifier for the "app instance" (device/user combination). Best practice implementation is for an app to generate a random GUID upon install/first-run, and continue to use that value on subsequent runs of the app.|
