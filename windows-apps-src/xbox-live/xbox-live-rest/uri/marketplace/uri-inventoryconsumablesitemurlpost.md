## Remarks

   * If the quantity the caller asked to consume exceeds the remaining supply of the item, the call will be rejected.
   * The quantity the caller asked to consume must be a positive integer above 0. Calls with a consumption value of 0 or lower will be rejected.
   * If the caller provides an empty Transaction ID, the request will be rejected.
   * If available the title claim will be logged so that it will be possible to determine which title is reporting the consumption.
   * Additional POSTs with the same transactionId will be ignored for some time period.
