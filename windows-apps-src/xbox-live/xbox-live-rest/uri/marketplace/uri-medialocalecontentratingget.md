## Remarks
 
Enforcing parental controls over the content children are allowed to see is a complicated task. Not only does each media item type have its own rating system, but those rating systems can vary from country to country. This means that there are several different pieces of data that need to be specified to properly filter all items.
 
Instead of specifying all of the parameters in all API calls, this API generates a value to pass into **combinedContentRating** parameters in other APIs and still communicate the same information. This is designed to make the APIs easier to use and maintain, as the several parameters passed into this API are collapsed into a single, reusable value for the other APIs.
 
Although the exact values returned by this API may eventually change, they should change very infrequently (such as between releases of Entertainment Discovery Services (EDS)) and thus could be cached for long periods of time. Any API accepting a **combinedContentRating** parameter will give a meaningful error message if the value passed in is invalid, which is an indication the caller merely needs to call this API again to get an updated value. If an API accepts a **combinedContentRating** parameter, but one isn't provided, no filtering of content will take place based on parental controls. 

> [!NOTE] 
> This doesn't mean that only "safe" content is returned -- it means that all content is returned, including potentially explicit content.
