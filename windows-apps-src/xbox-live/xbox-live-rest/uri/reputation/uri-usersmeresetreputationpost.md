## Remarks
 
This method may also be called by any other Partners for all sandboxes except Retail, and by users in all sandboxes except Retail, for testing purposes. Note that this request sets a user's "base" reputation scores, and his positive feedback weightings will all be zeroed out. The user's actual reputation after making this call will be these base scores plus his ambassador bonus plus his follower bonus.
