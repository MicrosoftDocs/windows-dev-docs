All other members are prohibited in a request.

### Sample request

The session referred to by the **ticketSessionRef** object must be created before a match ticket can be created, and the session must contain the players to be matched, along with their player-specific attributes. Each player must create or join the session against the MPSD, adding associated match attributes to the session. The match attributes are placed in a custom property field called matchAttrs on each player.

A create or join request is submitted to **http://sessiondirectory.xboxlive.com/serviceconfigs/{scid}/sessiontemplates/{templatename}/sessions/{sessionname}** and might look like this:


```cpp
{
   "members": {
     "me": {
       "constants": {
         "system": {
           "xuid": 2535285330879750
         }
      },
      "properties": {
         "custom": {
           "matchAttrs": {
             "skill": 5,
             "ageRange": "teenager"
           }
         }
      }
    }
  }
}

```


Once the session has been created, the title can call the matchmaking service to create the ticket for that session.


> [!NOTE] 
> A title can enable a user to retry this call, but should not retry it automatically if the data fails.  



```cpp
POST /serviceconfigs/{scid}/hoppers/{hoppername}

{
  "giveUpDuration":10,
  "preserveSession": "never",
  "ticketSessionRef": {
     "scid": "ABBACDDC-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",  
     "templateName": "TestTemplate",
     "name": "5E55104-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  },
  "ticketAttributes": {
    "desiredMap": "Test Map",
    "desiredGameType": "Test GameType"
  }
}

```
