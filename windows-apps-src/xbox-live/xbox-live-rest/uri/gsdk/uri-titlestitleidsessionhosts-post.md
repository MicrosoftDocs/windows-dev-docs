## Remarks
 
A title should only retry the call to the service when the following response codes are received:
 
   * 200—Success - response returned.
   * 400—Invalid parameters or malformed request body.
   * 401—Unauthorized
   * 404—Title id doesnt have any subscriptions assigned to it.
   * 409—When identical request are made (same sessionId) at roughly the same time, this response is possible. If an allocate request is made and a session host already has the specified sessionId AND it is already Active we will return information detailing that sessionhost. If the session host however, is NOT Active yet, you will receive a Conflict.
   * 500—Unexpected server error.
   * 503—No sessionhosts StandingBy. Retry the request when some of these resources are free.
