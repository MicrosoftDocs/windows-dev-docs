| X-RequestedServiceVersion| string| Build name/number of the Xbox LIVE service to which this request should be directed. The request will only be routed to that service after verifying the validity of the header, the claims in the auth token, and so on. Default value: 1.|

If still no matching localized strings are found, it uses the default strings provided by the title developer/publisher. |
