## Remarks
 
All data to query for the clip is available in the **GameClip** objects as returned from any metadata query. **XUID**, **ServiceConfigId**, **GameClipId** and **SandboxId** in the claims of the request are required to get a single game clip via this API. If the game clip has been flagged for enforcement, or Content Isolation or privacy checks determine that the user does not have permission to get the specific game clip, the API will return an HTTP status code of 404 (Not Found).
 
**SandboxId** is now retrieved from the claim in the XToken and enforced. If the **SandboxId** is not present, then Entertainment Discovery Services (EDS) will throw a 400 Bad request error.
 
This API must also be used to refresh expired URIs. When the query is complete, any expired URIs for the game clip will be refreshed accordingly. 

> [!NOTE] 
> A URI refresh can take up to 30-40 seconds after this request is done. If the URI has expired, attempting to use it immediately for streaming operations will get an HTTP 500 status code from the IIS Smooth Streaming Servers. We are working on ways to shorten this, and this note will be updated accordingly as that work progresses.
