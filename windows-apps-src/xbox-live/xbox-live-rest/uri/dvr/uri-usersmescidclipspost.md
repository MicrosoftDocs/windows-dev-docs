## Remarks
 
This is the first part of the GameClip upload process. Upon capture of a video, it's recommended to call the GameClips service immediately to obtain the ID and URI for the upload of the bits, even if the upload is not scheduled to start right away. This call will perform user quota checks and other checks through content isolation, privacy, and so on to see if a video should even be scheduled for upload by the client. A positive response from this call indicates the service is willing to accept the video clip for upload. All clips uploaded must be associated with a specific title (through a SCID) to be accepted in the system.
 
This call is not idempotent; subsequent calls will cause different IDs and URIs to be issued. Retries on failure should follow standard client-side back-off behavior.
