## Remarks

After the **InitialUploadResponse** is returned, the upload is performed through the **uploadUri** returned in that object. The client should split the file into **expectedBlocks** sequential blocks, no larger than 2 MB each. They can be uploaded in parallel.

If you are uploading the file in blocks, the server will return an HTTP status code of Accepted (202) for each request, until it has received all expected blocks, in which case it commits all blocks as one file, returning Created (201). In these cases, the response does not contain an object, and the server may schedule additional processing. On error, a **ServiceErrorResponse** object may be returned along with an appropriate HTTP status code.

On a recoverable error code, the client should retry using a standard back-off retry mechanism.

> [!NOTE] 
> Even if an upload completes successfully, further processing will occur that could reject the clip for reasons not related to the upload or metadata supplementing process.
