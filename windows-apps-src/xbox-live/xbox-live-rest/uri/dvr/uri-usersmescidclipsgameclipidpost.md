## Remarks
 
The API for updating game clip metadata falls into two categories, updating the metadata of one's own game clips such as accessibility and title, and updating of the public attributes (like applying a rating or incrementing the view count) of any other game clip. If the XUID in the URI does not match the XUID in the claim, only the public data can be edited and any request to edit any of the other data will be denied. In the case multiple fields are attempting to be edited and one of them is invalid for the request, the entire request would fail.

## Related URIs
 
The following URIs update public fields in the metadata. There is no body required for these requests. Upon successful update of the metadata an HTTP status code of 200 will be returned. Otherwise a ServiceErrorResponse object in JSON format will be returned with an appropriate HTTP status code.
 
   * **POST /users/{ownerId}/scids/{scid}/clips/{gameClipId}/ratings/{rating value}** - applies the specified rating to the specified clip. Rating Value should be an integer between 1 and 5.
   * **POST /users/{ownerId}/scids/{scid}/clips/{gameClipId}/flag** - flags the clip to contain potentially questionable content to be checked by enforcement.
   * **POST /users/{ownerId}/scids/{scid}/clips/{gameClipId}/views** - increments the view count for the specified game clip. It is recommended that this is called not right when playback is started, but when 75%-80% of playback has been completed.
