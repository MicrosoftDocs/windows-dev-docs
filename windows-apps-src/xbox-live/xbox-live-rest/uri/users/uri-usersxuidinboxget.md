## Remarks

A user message summary contains only the message subject. For user-generated messages, this is currently the first 20 characters of the message text. System messages may provide an alternate subject, such as "LIVE System".

Messages are returned in the reverse of the order they were sent; that is, newer messages are returned first.

The only content type this API supports is "application/json", which is required in the HTTP headers of each call.
