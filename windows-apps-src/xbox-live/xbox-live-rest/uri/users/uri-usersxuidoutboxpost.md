## Effect of privacy settings on resource

Successfully sending a user message to a player, whether that player is a friend or not, results in a result code of 200. However, if you send a message to someone who has blocked you, the recipient will not receive the message, and you will not receive any indication that your message wasn't successful.

There are also limits on how many messages can be sent per day and to how many friends and non-friends, as follows.

   * 20 strangers per message
   * 200 strangers per 24 hours
   * 250 total messages per 24 hours
   * 2500 total recipients per 24 hours
