## Remarks
 
The ?include=valuemetadata query parameter allows the response to include any metadata associated with the leaderboard values. The value metadata contains client specified data associated with the value, such as the model and color of a car used to achieve a best time on a race track.
 
Value metadata is defined on the user stat that the leaderboard is based on, not on the leaderboard itself.
 
Leaderboard APIs are all read-only and therefore only support the GET verb. They reflect ranked and sorted "pages" of indexed player stats that are derived from individual user stats that were written via the Data Platform. Full leaderboard indexes can be quite large, and callers will never ask to see one in its entirety, therefore this URI supports several query string arguments that allow a caller to be specific about what kind of view it wants to see against that leaderboard.
 
GET operations won't modify any resources so this will produce the same results if executed once or multiple times.

## URI parameters
 
| Parameter| Type| Description| 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| scid| GUID| Identifier of the service configuration which contains the resource being accessed.| 
| leaderboardname| string| Unique identifier of the predefined leaderboard resource being accessed.| 
  
<a id="ID4ESB"></a>

 
## Query string parameters
 
| Parameter| Type| Description| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| include=valuemetadata| string| Indicates that the response includes any value metadata associated with the leaderboard values.| 
| maxItems| 32-bit unsigned integer| Maximum number of leaderboard records to return in a page of results. If not specified, a default number will be returned (10). The max value for maxItems is still undefined, but we want to avoid large data sets, so this value should probably target the largest set that a tuner UI could handle per call.| 
| skipToRank| 32-bit unsigned integer| Return a page of results starting with the specified leaderboard rank. The rest of the results will be in sort order by rank. This query string can return a continuation token which can be fed back into a subsequent query to get "the next page" of results.| 
| skipToUser| string| Return a page of leaderboard results around the specified gamer xuid, regardless of that user's rank or score. The page will be ordered by percentile rank with the specified user in the last position of the page for predefined views, or in the middle for stat leaderboard views. There is no continuationToken provided for this type of query.| 
| continuationToken| string| If a previous call returned a continuationToken, then the caller can pass back that token "as is" in a query string to get the next page of results.| 
  
<a id="ID4EVD"></a>

 
## Authorization
 
There is authorization logic implemented for content-isolation and access-control scenarios.
 
   * Both leaderboards and user stats can be read from clients on any platform, provided that the caller submits a valid XSTS token with the request. Writes are obviously limited to clients supported by the Data Platform.
   * Title developers can mark statistics as open or restricted with XDP or Partner Center. Leaderboards are open statistics. Open statistics can be accessed by Smartglass, as well as iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone, and web applications, as long as the user is authorized to the sandbox. User authorization to a sandbox is managed through XDP or Partner Center.
  
Pseudo-code for the check looks like this:
 

```cpp
If (!checkAccess(serviceConfigId, resource, CLAIM[userid, deviceid, titleid]))
{
        Reject request as Unauthorized
}

// else accept request.
         
```

## Effect of privacy settings on resource
 
No privacy checks are performed when reading leaderboard data.

### Sample response
 
The following request URI depicts skipping to rank on a global leaderboard.
 

```cpp
https://leaderboards.xboxlive.com/scids/0FA0D955-56CF-49DE-8668-05D82E6D45C4/leaderboards/TotalFlagsCaptured?include=valuemetadata&maxItems=3&skipToRank=15000
         
```

 
In order to return value metadata, the following header must also be specified.
 

```cpp
X-Xbl-Contract-Version : 3
          
```

 
The URI above returns the following JSON response.
 

```cpp
{
    "pagingInfo": {
        "continuationToken": "15003",
        "totalItems": 23437
