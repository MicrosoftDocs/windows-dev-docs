## Remarks

The ?include=valuemetadata query parameter allows the response to include any metadata associated with the user stat values, such as the model and color of a car used to achieve a time on a race track.

To include value metadata in the response, the request call must also set the header value X-Xbl-Contract-Version to 3.

## URI parameters

| --- | --- | --- |
| xuid| GUID| Xbox User ID (XUID) of the user on whose behalf to access the service configuration.|
| scid| GUID| Identifier of the service configuration that contains the resource being accessed.|

<a id="ID4ELB"></a>


## Query string parameters

| Parameter| Type| Description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| statNames| string| A comma delimited list of user statistic names.For example, the following URI informs the service that four statistics are requested on behalf of the user id specified in the URI.{::nomakrdown}<br/><br/>`https://userstats.xboxlive.com/users/xuid({xuid})/scids/{scid}/stats/wins,kills,kdratio,headshots?include=valuemetadata`|

## Authorization

There is authorization logic implemented for content-isolation and access-control scenarios.

   * Both leaderboards and user statistics can be read from clients on any platform, provided that the caller submits a valid XSTS token with the request. Writes are limited to clients supported by the Data Platform.
   * Title developers can mark statistics as open or restricted with XDP or Partner Center. Leaderboards are open statistics. Open statistics can be accessed by Smartglass, as well as iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone, and web applications, as long as the user is authorized to the sandbox. User authorization to a sandbox is managed through XDP or Partner Center.

Pseudo-code for the check looks like this:


```cpp
If (!checkAccess(serviceConfigId, resource, CLAIM[userid, deviceid, titleid]))
{
        Reject request as Unauthorized
}

// else accept request.

```
