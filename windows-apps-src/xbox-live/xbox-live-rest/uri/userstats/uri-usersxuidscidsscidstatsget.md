## Remarks

clients need a way to read and write title statistics on behalf of players to our new player statistics system.

## URI parameters

| Parameter| Type| Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| xuid| GUID| Xbox User ID (XUID) of the user on whose behalf to access the service configuration.|
| scid| GUID| Identifier of the service configuration that contains the resource being accessed.|

## Query string parameters

| Parameter| Type| Description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| statNames| string| The only query string parameter is the comma delimited user statistic name URI noun.For example, the following URI informs the service that four statistics are requested on behalf of the user id specified in the URI. `https://userstats.xboxlive.com/users/xuid({xuid})/scids/{scid}/stats/wins,kills,kdratio,headshots`There will be a limit on the number of statistics that can be requested in a single call, and that limit will carefully consider a "sweet spot" for developer convenience vs. URI length practicality. For example, the limit might be determined by either 600 characters worth of statistic name text (including the commas), or 10 statistics maximum. Enabling a simple GET like this enables HTTP caching for commonly requested statistics, which reduces call volume from chatty clients. |

## Authorization

There is authorization logic implemented for content-isolation and access-control scenarios.

   * Both leaderboards and user statistics can be read from clients on any platform, provided that the caller submits a valid XSTS token with the request. Writes are obviously limited to clients supported by the Data Platform.
   * Title developers can mark statistics as open or restricted with XDP or Partner Center. Leaderboards are open statistics. Open statistics can be accessed by Smartglass, as well as iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone, and web applications, as long as the user is authorized to the sandbox. User authorization to a sandbox is managed through XDP or Partner Center.

Pseudo-code for the check looks like this:


```cpp
If (!checkAccess(serviceConfigId, resource, CLAIM[userid, deviceid, titleid]))
{
        Reject request as Unauthorized
}

// else accept request.

```

| Authorization| string| Authentication credentials for HTTP authentication. Example value: "XBL3.0 x=&lt;userhash>;&lt;token>".|
