# POST (/system/strings/validate)
Accepts an array of strings for validation and returns an array of results of equal size. 
The domain for these URIs is `client-strings.xboxlive.com`.
 
  * [Remarks](#ID4EV)
  * [Required Request Headers](#ID4EIB)
  * [Request body](#ID4ELC)
  * [HTTP status codes](#ID4E4C)
  * [Response body](#ID4ETF)
 
<a id="ID4EV"></a>

 
## Remarks
 
Each result indicates whether the corresponding string is acceptable on Xbox LIVE, and contains the offending string if applicable.
 
Identical strings will always give identical results. If you receive a non-successful result, analyze the result and modify the string accordingly.
 
 

> [!NOTE] 
> The resulting <b>VerifyStringResult</b> will only report the first offending word in the string. There might be additional offending words within the string. If you plan to replace the offending words to make the string usable, you should replace the offending word or substring and then re-verify the string to look for additional offending substrings.
