# Contextual Search

## Introducing Contextual Search
Contextual Search is a new Xbox Live Service that enables truly next gen scenarios for gaming media content.  With Contextual Search,  Xbox Live automatically tags broadcasts and game clips from your game with real time stats of your choosing. For example, you could choose to tag a game clip with the level the user is on, the weapon they are carrying, or perhaps their current K/D ratio.  Xbox Live also  exposes a search interface off this data, enabling users or titles to discover and surface the perfect content.  For example, leveraging Contextual Search, a user could find all the Halo 2 game clips where the creator is playing Slayer on Lockout or Blood Gulch and have the results sorted by the players rank, ensuring the best content bubbles to the top.  

Contextual Search flexes your game's data and the power of Xbox Live to unlock a number of powerful scenarios.  This includes:

* Contextual game help
* Showcasing top content creators
* Surface new DLC in action
* Contextually deliver creator commentary

Simply by configuring in XDP or Partner Center, Contextual Search for your title will automatically light up in broadcasting applications immediately, and the Xbox Shell and Cortana at a later date.  Additionally, titles can leverage the search APIs directly in game, enabling differentiated experiences for users without leaving the game.  Regardless of the level of integration, you'll generate a tremendous amount of value and exposure for your title.
