# Rich Presence appendix

## Data Platform

The basics of the data platform are part of the Entertainment as a Service initiative. The idea is that everything in a game can be described as events with attributes associated with those events. Developers can configure statistics and state values important to the game's experience in the service.

Some example statistics are:

-   Number of kills
-   Number of side quests completed
-   Number of coins collected
-   Number of miles driven

Some example state data are:

-   Current map
-   Current X, Y, Z coordinates
-   Current weapon

For more information about stats, see [Player Stats](../../leaderboards-and-stats-2017/player-stats.md).
