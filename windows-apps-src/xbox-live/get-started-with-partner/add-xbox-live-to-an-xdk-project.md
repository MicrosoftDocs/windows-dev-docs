# Add Xbox Live to a new or existing XDK project

This topic outlines how to add Xbox Live to a new or existing XDK project.

The process is:

- Setup Up Your Xbox One Development Environment
- Get your IDs
- Configure your development console
- Add the TitleID and SCID to your binary


## Setup Up Your Xbox One Development Environment
First, setup the console by following "Setting Up Your Xbox One Development Environment" section in the XDK documentation

## Get your IDs

To enable Xbox Live services, you will need to obtain several IDs to configure your development kit and your title. These can be done with the same process.

You will obtain your IDs by doing the process of [Xbox Live service configuration](../xbox-live-service-configuration.md)

## Configure your development console

Once you have your IDs, follow the [Configure your development console](configure-your-development-console.md) guide to setup your development console.

## Add the TitleID and SCID to your binary
While the Sandbox is configured on a platform level for each Development Kit, the TitleID and SCID are bound to a specific binary. To add a TitleID and SCID to your binary, modify the Package.appxmanifest for that binary by adding a new node in the <Extensions> node as follows:

```
<Applications>
    ...
    <Application ...>
      ...
      <Extensions>
        <mx:Extension Category="xbox.live">
           <mx:XboxLive TitleId="<your titleID>" PrimaryServiceConfigId="<your SCID>" RequireXboxLive="<boolean indicating Live requirement>" />
        </mx:Extension>
      </Extensions>
   </Application>
</Applications>
```

For more information on the AppxManifest.xml file, refer to Project Templates in Visual Studio for Xbox One Development.

See Application Manifest Schema for a description of the application manifest schema.

**The RequireXboxLive Flag**
If the RequireXboxLive flag is set to true, the title will not launch unless the Windows.Networking.Connectivity Connection Level returns as XboxLiveAccess and the title clears authentication with Xbox Live. This insures the title has taken the latest content updates. If connectivity is lost while the title is running, the title is suspended.

Only "Internet Required" titles should mark RequireXboxLive as true, and note that marking your title in this way does not guarantee the required services for the title are up and running.
