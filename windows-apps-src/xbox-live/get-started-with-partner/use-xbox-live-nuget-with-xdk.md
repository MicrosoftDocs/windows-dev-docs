1.	Search for `Xbox Live` and select the appropriate package and click `Install`.
  - The Xbox Services API comes in flavors for both UWP and XDK, and for C++ and WinRT.  
  - Choose between `Microsoft.Xbox.Live.SDK.*.UWP` and `Microsoft.Xbox.Live.SDK.*.XboxOneXDK`.  `XboxOneXDK` is for ID@Xbox and Managed developers who are using the Xbox One XDK.  `UWP` is for UWP games which can run on either PC, the Xbox One, or Windows Phone.  You can read more about running UWP on Xbox One at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/getting-started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/getting-started)
  - Choose between `Microsoft.Xbox.Live.SDK.Cpp.*` and `Microsoft.Xbox.Live.SDK.WinRT.*`. `Cpp` is for C++ game engines using the Xbox Live APIs.  `WinRT` is for game engines written with C++, C#, or Javascript using the Xbox Live APIs.  When using WinRT with a C++ engine, you would use C++/CX which uses hats (^).  `Cpp` is the recommended API to use for C++ game engines.

* For `Microsoft.Xbox.Live.SDK.WinRT.*` based projects, no need to include any headers.
