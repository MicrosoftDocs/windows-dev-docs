# Add and compile the Xbox Live APIs source in your UWP project

The Xbox Live API (XSAPI) source is now available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api). Developers can follow these instructions to update their projects to use a local build.

You might want to build XSAPI yourself if:
1. If you want to debug an issue to understand where an error code is coming from.
1. If we provide a source code patch to fix an issue for you, before we can distribute a QFE.

To compile the XSAPI project yourself, follow the instructions on the GitHub project site.
