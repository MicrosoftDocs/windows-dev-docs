# How to get the Xbox Development Kit (XDK)

The Xbox Development Kit (XDK) is not publicly available. There are two groups, managed partners and ID@Xbox developers, who are allowed access to the XDK and associated development resources like documentation and middleware tools. The XDK can be downloaded from the [software downloads page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/xbox/partner/resources-softwaredownloads) on the developer.microsoft.com site.

If you do not have access to the site you will not be able to download or use the XDK. If you do no not have access contact your account manager.

In order to qualify for XDK access you can [apply to become an ID@Xbox developer](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id).
