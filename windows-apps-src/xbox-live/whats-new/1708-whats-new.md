# What's new for the Xbox Live APIs - August 2017

Please see the [What's New - July 2017](1707-whats-new.md) article for what was added in the July 2017 release.

## Xbox Live features

### In-Game clubs

Developers can now create "in-game clubs". In-game clubs differ from standard Xbox clubs in that they are fully customizable by a developer and can be used both inside and outside of the game. As a game developer, you can use them to quickly build any type of persistent group scenarios inside your games such as teams, clans, squads, guilds, etc. that match your unique requirements.

Xbox live members can access in-game clubs outside of your game across any Xbox experience to stay connected to each other and to your game by using club features like chat, feed, LFG, and Mixer freely on Xbox console, PC, or iOS/Android devices.

APIs are available to create & manage in-game clubs directly from within your game. These APIs exist in the xbox::services::clubs namespace.
