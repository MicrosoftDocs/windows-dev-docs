## June 2018

### Xbox Live Features

#### C API layer for XSAPI

C APIs are now available for some Xbox Live features. The new API layer provides a number of benefits for the supported features, including custom memory management, manual thread management for asynchronous tasks, and a new HTTP library.

For more information, see [Xbox Live C APIs](../xsapi-flat-c.md).

## August 2017

### Xbox Live features

#### In-Game clubs

Developers can now create "in-game clubs". In-game clubs differ from standard Xbox clubs in that they are fully customizable by a developer and can be used both inside and outside of the game. As a game developer, you can use them to quickly build any type of persistent group scenarios inside your games such as teams, clans, squads, guilds, etc. that match your unique requirements.

Xbox live members can access in-game clubs outside of your game across any Xbox experience to stay connected to each other and to your game by using club features like chat, feed, LFG, and Mixer freely on Xbox console, PC, or iOS/Android devices.

APIs are available to create & manage in-game clubs directly from within your game. These APIs exist in the xbox::services::clubs namespace.

## July 2017

### Xbox Live features

#### Tournaments

New APIs have been added to support tournaments. You can now use the xbox::services::tournaments::tournament_service class to access the tournaments service from your title.
These new tournament APIs enable the following scenarios:

* Query the service to find all existing tournaments for the current title.
* Retrieve details about a tournament from the service.
* Query the service to retrieve a list of teams for a tournament.
* Retrieve details about the teams for a tournament from the service.
* Track changes to tournaments and teams by using Real Time Activity (RTA) subscriptions.

## March 2017

### Xbox Services API

#### Data Platform 2017

We have introduced a simplified Stats API.  Traditionally you had to send events corresponding to stat rules defined on XDP or Partner Center and these would update the stat values in the cloud.  We refer to this model as Stats 2013.

With Stats 2017, your title is now in control of your stat values.  You simply call an API with the most recent stat value, and that gets sent to the service directly without the need for events.  This uses the new `StatsManager` API and you can read more in [Player Stats](../leaderboards-and-stats-2017/player-stats.md)

#### GitHub

Xbox Live API (XSAPI) is now available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api).  Using the binaries that come with the XDK or as NuGet packages is still recommended, however you are welcome to use the source and we welcome source code contributions.  

### Xbox Live Creators Program

The Xbox Live Creators Program is a developer program offering a subset of Xbox Live functionality to a broader developer audience.  If you are already in the ID@Xbox program, this will not have any impact on you.

You can read more about the program in [Developer Program Overview](../developer-program-overview.md).
