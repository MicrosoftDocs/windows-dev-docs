# Leaderboards data in Unity

For those of you who want a custom leaderboard experience, this article will give you the tools to implement your own leaderboard by going over the APIs available to Unity developers. Once you understand how to pull down leaderboard data you will be able to apply it to the user interface of your choosing.

[!IMPORTANT]
> This article applies to a version of the plugin prior to an update made in May of 2018 (1804 Release). If you installed the Xbox Live Plugin after that time, or have not yet downloaded it you may have a newer version which uses different calls to collect leaderboard data. In addition to this you will find that the screenshots in this plugin do not match those of the most recent release. Please instead refer to the [newer unity leaderboards from scratch article](unity-leaderboard-from-scratch.md).


## Call for Leaderboard data

In order to request leaderboard data from the Xbox Live service you must call  `void GetLeaderboard(XboxLiveUser user,  LeaderboardQuery query)`

To successfully make this call you will need to acquire an `XboxLiveUser` from [sign-in](unity-prefabs-and-sign-in.md), have a [configured stat](add-stats-and-leaderboards-in-unity.md) with value for at least one player, and form a `LeaderboardQuery`. You can read the linked articles if you do not already know how to sign-in a user or need to initialize a statistic for your leaderboard. Once you have a initialized a statistic the easiest way to associate it with your leaderboard script is to include one of the statistic prefabs: `IntegerStat`, `DoubleStat`, or `StringStat` as a public variable. Your stat will need to have it's ID property configured at the very least as this is what we will use for the **statName** parameter when we call for our leaderboard data. Finally you will need to form a `LeaderboardQuery` object.
A `LeaderboardQuery` has a few attributes that can be set which will effect the data returned:

- **StatName(Required):** this is the ID of the stat your leaderboard will retrieve data for, if this is not set not set to a stats ID value, no data will be returned.
- **SocialGroup:** depending on the value of this string your returned leaderboard data will be filtered to your friends, your favorite friends, or if not set, will retrieve an unfiltered global leaderboard. The value "" will returns an unfiltered list, the value "all" will return a list with only your friends in it, "favorite" will return a list with only your favorite friends present.
- **SkipResultToRank:** if set, this uint variable will determine what ranking the Leaderboard data will start with when returning. Rankings start at rank 1.
- **SkipResultToMe:** if set to true this boolean value will cause the leaderboard data returned to start at the `XboxLiveUser` used in the `GetLeaderboard()` call.
- **Order:** Enums of type `Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard.SortOrder` have two possible values, ascending, and descending. Setting this variable for your query will determine the sort order of your leaderboard. By default leaderboards return data in descending order.
- **MaxItems:** This uint determines the maximum number of rows to return per call to `GetLeaderboard()`.

Forming your LeaderboardQuery may look like the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard;

LeaderboardQuery query = new LeaderboardQuery
        {
            StatName = stat.ID,
            SkipResultToRank = 100,
            MaxItems = 5
        };
```

Using this query will return five rows of the leaderboard starting at the 100th ranked individual for the given stat.

> [!WARNING]
> Setting SkipResultToRank higher than the number of players contained within the leaderboard will cause the leaderboard data to return with zero rows.

Now that we have all of the pieces together we can call the `GetLeaderboard(XboxLiveUser user,  LeaderboardQuery query)` function, where we will use our signed in `XboxLiveUser` (likely an `XboxLiveUserInfo.User`) obtained from sign-in, as our user, and the `LeaderboardQuery` we just created as our query.

Your leaderboard calling function may look like the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard;

public void LoadLeaderboard()
    {
        // check to make sure you have a valid stat
        if (this.stat == null)
        {
            // TO DO: Display "Stat not specified" error message!
            return;
        }

        // check to make sure you have an XboxLiveUser
        if (this.xboxLiveUser == null)
        {
            if (XboxLiveUserManager.Instance.UserForSingleUserMode != null
                && XboxLiveUserManager.Instance.UserForSingleUserMode.User != null)
            {
                // set the XboxLiveUser if one is available
                this.xboxLiveUser = XboxLiveUserManager.Instance.UserForSingleUserMode.User;
            }
            else // if you don't have a user signed in display an error message and exit. 
            {
                // TO DO: Display "User Not logged In" error message
                return;
            }
        }

        LeaderboardQuery query;

        query = new LeaderboardQuery
        {
            StatName = this.stat.ID,
            MaxItems = this.maxItems,

        };

        XboxLive.Instance.StatsManager.GetLeaderboard(this.xboxLiveUser, query);
    }
```

Now, you may have noticed that our leaderboard retrieving function `GetLeaderboard()` returns void and thus does not return the leaderboard data we are looking for. We will actually retrieve the leaderboard data in an event function discussed in the next section.

## Receive the Leaderboard data

In order to retrieve the leaderboard data you will need to add a listening function to the `StatsManagerComponent` instance for your title. You should add the following line of code to the `Awake()` function of your code: `StatsManagerComponent.Instance.GetLeaderboardCompleted += this.MyGetLeaderboardCompletedFunction`.

```csharp
private void Awake()
    {
        this.EnsureEventSystem();
        XboxLiveServicesSettings.EnsureXboxLiveServicesSettings();

        StatsManagerComponent.Instance.GetLeaderboardCompleted += this.GetLeaderboardCompleted;
    }
```

The `StatsManagerComponent` listens for leaderboard completion events. By running this line of code, you will add a function  to the list of functions to be called when a leaderboard completion event occurs. In this example that function is called `MyGetLeaderBoardCompletedFunction()`, you can name the function as you like in your own script. The function "MyGetLeaderboardCompletedFunction" will need to take two parameters, an object that represents the sender, and a `Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Client.StatEventArgs` parameter. The shell of your function may look something like this:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Statistics.Manager;

private void MyGetLeaderBoardCompletedFunction(object sender, StatEventArgs statArgs)
    {
        //Do Something;
    }
```

The first thing this function should do is check for errors which can be found in the `StatEventArgs` parameter statArgs. StatArgs contains a `StatisticEvent` called EventData which contains the `System.Exception` called ErrorInfo. If there was an error in retrieving the leaderboard data you can find it in statArgs.EventData.ErrorInfo. You can add a simple if statement to the previous code to check for errors.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Statistics.Manager;

private void MyGetLeaderBoardCompletedFunction(object sender, StatEventArgs statArgs)
    {
        if (e.EventData.ErrorInfo != null && e.EventData.ErrorInfo.Message == "")
        {
            // TO DO: Display error message
            return;
        }
    }
```

After confirming that there are no errors, store the results of the leaderboard request which are found in `statArgs.EventData.EventArgs.Result`. `Result` is a `LeaderBoardResult` object which contains the data you need to populate your leaderboard. In our example code we will extract this data and send it to another function called LoadResult.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Statistics.Manager;

private void MyGetLeaderBoardCompletedFunction(object sender, StatEventArgs statArgs)
    {
        if (e.EventData.ErrorInfo != null && e.EventData.ErrorInfo.Message == "")
        {
            // TO DO: Display error message
            return;
        }

        LeaderboardResultEventArgs leaderboardArgs = (LeaderboardResultEventArgs)statArgs.EventData.EventArgs;
        this.LoadResult(leaderboardArgs.Result);
    }
```

The `LeaderboardResult` result that we send to the LoadResult function will have all the data we need to both read the leaderboard data that was returned as well as make additional calls to retrieve ranks not yet returned by the original call. You will want to store the results in a class variable for your leaderboard script like so:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard;

void LoadResult(LeaderboardResult result)
    {
        this.leaderboardData = result;
    }
```

This is important because the `LeaderboardResult` contains a HasNext property that determines whether or not there is a later section of the leaderboard that can be retrieved. The `LeaderboardResult` also stores a variable for the total of rows that make up the leaderboard. These properties will be important to navigating your leaderboard. To pull data from your `LeaderBoardResult` simply implement a for loop using the `LeaderboardResults` list of `LeaderboardRow` called `Rows`. In our sample code we are simply going to concatenate the values in each `LeaderboardRow` into a string to be displayed.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard

void LoadResult(LeaderboardResult result)
{

    this.leaderboardData = result;

    this.leaderBoardText.text = "" // leaderBoardText is a UnityEngine.UI text box.

    foreach (LeaderboardRow row in this.leaderboardData.Rows)
    {
        leaderBoardText.text += string.Format("Rank: {0} | Gamertag: {1} | {2}:{3}\n\n", row.Rank, row.Gamertag, this.stat.DisplayName, row.Values[0]);
    }
}
```

In our example we used the Rank, Gamertag, and Values properties of `LeaderBoardResult` to populate our strings, as well as the DisplayName of the stat associated with the leaderboard.

I am sure you'll be able to do something more creative with all of this leaderboard data.

## Navigating the Leaderboard data

In the most common instances you will not load every single rank in your leaderboard at once, and will need to be able to navigate the ranks to display different sections of the leaderboard for the user. Let us say that you have a leaderboard with one-hundred ranked players. In your initial call to `GetLeaderboard()` you retrieve ten `LeaderboardRows` and display them for the player. The player may want to see more than the top ten players. The easiest way to get the next set of ten users is to determine whether or not the `LeaderboardResult` you stored from your last query has more rows to retrieve and then calling `GetLeaderboard()` with that LeaderboardResult's `NextQuery` property. The following code will retrieve the next set of leaderboard data.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services;
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard;

void GetNextLeaders()
    {
        if(this.leaderboardData.HasNext)
        {
            LeaderboardQuery query = this.leaderboardData.NextQuery;
            XboxLive.Instance.StatsManager.GetLeaderboard(this.xboxLiveUser, query);
        }
        else
        {
            //TO DO: Display an error message or go back to the beginning of the leaderboard as the situation demands.
        }
    }
```

Moving backwards in your leaderboard is a little more difficult as there is no function to pull the previous X number of ranks from your leaderboard. In order to retrieve previous rankings you will have to write your own logic. One method would be to store your `MaxItems` per `LeaderboardQuery` and calculate what rank you need to skip to using the `SkipToRank` attribute of your `LeaderboardQuery`. That code might look something like this:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services;
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard;

void GetPreviousLeader()
{
    if(leaderboardData == null || leaderboardData.Rows.Count < 1)
    {
        return;
    }

    uint topRank = leaderboardData.Rows[0].Rank; //get the first rank of the leaderboard.
    uint targetRank = topRank - this.maxItems > 0 ? topRank - this.maxItems : 0; //set your targetRank equal to the current top rank of your leaderboard minus the configured number of rows to display at a time.

    LeaderboardQuery query = new LeaderboardQuery // make a new query with the calculated targetRank
    {
        StatName = stat.ID,
        SkipResultToRank = targetRank,
        MaxItems = this.maxItems
    };

    XboxLive.Instance.StatsManager.GetLeaderboard(this.xboxLiveUser, query); // call the GetLeaderboard() function with the new query
}
```

The final most common scenario is that a player may simply want to see their spot on the leaderboard. This is easily achieved by calling the `GetLeaderboard()` function with a query where the `SkipResultToMe` attribute is set to true.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services;
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard;

    void GetRankForTag()
    {

        LeaderboardQuery query = new LeaderboardQuery // make a new query with the calculated targetRank
        {
            StatName = stat.ID,
            SkipResultToMe = true,
            MaxItems = this.maxItems
        };

        XboxLive.Instance.StatsManager.GetLeaderboard(this.xboxLiveUser, query); // call the GetLeaderboard() function with the new query
    }
```
