## Xbox Live policies

**Document version: 2.0**

Thank you for your interest in adding Xbox Live to your Windows 10 or Xbox One game. Xbox Live is an important part of the Windows 10 and Xbox One games story, and we look forward to seeing the innovations you bring to that experience.

Policies related to implementing Xbox Live in your game title vary based on the partner program in which you are granted access.

For creators in the Xbox Live Creators Program, visit the [Microsoft Store Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/agreements/store-policies) for all policies relating to the submission of your game to the Store across all Microsoft Devices (PC, Xbox One, phone, etc). Note that there are additional requirements for apps that are primarily gaming experiences or target Xbox One, detailed in the section titled [Gaming and Xbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/agreements/store-policies#1013-gaming-and-xbox).

For ID@Xbox or other Xbox managed partner programs, visit the [Xbox One Home Page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/xbox/partner) for more information on the policies for your game title. If you have trouble accessing that page, please contact your Microsoft representative.
