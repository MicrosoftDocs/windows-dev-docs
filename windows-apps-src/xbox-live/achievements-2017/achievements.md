# Achievements

In 2005, Xbox LIVE introduced the gaming industry to the notion of an achievement, a system-wide mechanism for directing and rewarding users' in-game actions in a consistent manner across all games.

With Xbox One, the achievement system expands to engage users across a broader range of activities, devices, and scenarios. Achievements are now more inclusive, more social, and more engaging than ever before! Developers and publishers can create achievements with new achievement types and rewards that go beyond Gamerscore. Gamerscore is still a key reward, however, so developers can now add more achievements and gamerscore over the lifetime of the title, even without a new content release. Across the board, achievements on Xbox One have been reimagined to give service-like flexibility to titles.

## Feature Summary ##
This list provides a summary of the key features and components that contribute to the achievement system on Xbox One.

Feature | Description
--- | ---
Persistent Achievements (achievements) | This type of achievement exists for the lifetime of the title. Users may unlock them at any time. A persistent achievementâ€™s required activity must always be available for users to complete and its reward must always be earnable.
Challenge Achievements (challenges) | This type of achievement is only available for a limited time. The publisher determines the dates during which a challenge achievement is available to unlock, and users must unlock it within that predefined timeframe to receive the recognition and its reward.
Post-Launch Achievements | Add achievements after title launch with no additional code required.
Achievement Progression | Now users can see how far along they are toward unlocking the achievement, even from the dashboard, giving them more reasons to fire up your title.
Unlock Tangible Rewards | In addition to Gamerscore, which are a critical part of the Xbox gaming experience, Xbox One users can unlock special game-related rewards such as digital artwork, new maps, unlockable characters, and temporary stat boosts via Xbox Live Achievements.
Achievement Activity Feed | Users can easily discover which achievements are recently popular amongst their friends and which rewards are being earned.
One Gamerscore | Any Gamerscore that a user earns on legacy platforms or modern platforms will count toward a single Gamerscore.

## Making achievements work well with the Guide UI ##
The Guide UI on Xbox One consoles highlights the real-time achievement activity of your users. To make the most of this built-in capability, your title should send updates about the user's progress toward unlocking an achievement. Titles whose achievements support progression tracking provide users with a more detailed, useful view into their current progress toward unlocking each of the title's achievements. Additionally, the Guide UI will automatically sort the title's achievements by progress percentage, making it even easier for users to figure out which achievements they may be able to quickly knock out in their next play session.
