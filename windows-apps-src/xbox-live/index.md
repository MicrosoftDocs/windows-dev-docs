# What is Xbox Live?

Xbox Live is a premier gaming network that connects millions of gamers across the world. You can add Xbox Live to your Windows 10 or Xbox One game in order to take advantage of the Xbox Live features and services.

With the Xbox Live Creators Program, anyone with a [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) account can build an Xbox Live enabled Universal Windows Platform (UWP) game that can run on both Windows 10 PCs and Xbox One consoles.

For game developers that want to take advantage of the full Xbox Live experience, including multiplayer, achievements, and native Xbox console development, there are additional developer programs which are detailed in the [Developer Program Overview](developer-program-overview.md).

Here are some reasons to add Xbox Live to your game:

- Xbox Live unites gamers across Xbox One and Windows 10, so gamers can play with their friends and connect with a massive community of players.
- Xbox Live lets players build a gaming legacy by unlocking achievements, sharing epic game clips, amassing Gamerscore, and perfecting their avatar.
- Xbox Live lets gamers play and pick up where they left off on another Xbox One or PC, bringing all their saves from another device.
- With over 1 billion multiplayer matches played each month, Xbox Live is built for performance, speed and reliability.
- With cross-device multiplayer, gamers can play with your friends regardless of whether they play on Xbox One or Windows 10 PC.

## How Xbox Live works

On a technical level, Xbox Live is a collection of micro-services that expose Xbox Live features such as profile, friends and presence, stats, leaderboards, achievements, multiplayer, and matchmaking. Xbox Live data is stored in the cloud, and can be accessed by using REST endpoints and secure websockets that are accessible from a set of client-side APIs designed for game developers.

In addition to the REST APIs, there are client side APIs that wrap the REST functionality. For more information, see [Introduction to Xbox Live APIs](introduction-to-xbox-live-apis.md).
