| [Network communications in the background](network-communications-in-the-background.md) | Apps use background tasks and two main mechanisms to maintain communications when they are not in the foreground: The socket broker, and control channel triggers.                  |

This topic provides in-depth guidance on using the Windows.Networking.Sockets namespace to perform networking operations. |
| [WebSockets](websockets.md)                                                             | WebSockets provide a mechanism for fast, secure two-way communication between a client and a server over the web using HTTP(S).                 |
