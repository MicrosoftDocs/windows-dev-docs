# Map OpenGL ES 2.0 to Direct3D 11



When starting the process of porting your graphics architecture from OpenGL ES 2.0 to Direct3D for the first time, familiarize yourself with the key differences between the APIs. The topics in this section help you plan your port strategy and the API changes that you must make when moving your graphics processing to Direct3D.

In terms of API design, however, the major components for creating and managing the shader stages are parts of two primary interfaces, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh404575"><strong>ID3D11Device1</strong></a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh404598"><strong>ID3D11DeviceContext1</strong></a>. This topic attempts to map common OpenGL ES 2.0 shader pipeline API patterns to the Direct3D 11 equivalents in these interfaces.</p></td>

## Notes on specific OpenGL ES 2.0 providers


These topics use the Khronos OpenGL ES 2.0 specification with platform-agnostic C. Both iOS and Android utilize the same specification and OpenGL ES 2.0 code developed for those platforms is very similar to the code snippets we will walk through, although they are typically exposed as object-oriented APIs. Also, due to the intricacies and language differences of each platform, there may be minor differences, especially in method parameter types, or in general language syntax. iOS, for instance, uses Objective-C. Android has the capability to use C++; however, some developers may have relied on a pure Java implementation. With that in mind, these topics should still be useful as the overall concepts, structure and usage of the OpenGL ES APIs do not differ.
