# Game programming

The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) offers new opportunities to create, distribute, and monetize games. Learn about creating a game for Windows 10.

| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [Windows 10 game development guide](e2e.md) | An end-to-end guide with resources and information for developing UWP games. |
| [Planning](planning.md) | This topic contains a list of articles for the game planning stage. |
| [UWP programming](uwp-programming.md) | Learn how to use Windows Runtime APIs to develop UWP games. |
| [Game development videos](game-development-videos.md) | A collection of game dev videos from major conferences and events. |

To learn about developing UWP games using DirectX, go to [DirectX programming](directx-programming.md).

To make the best use of the game development overviews and tutorials, we recommend that you're familiar with these subjects.

- [C++/WinRT](../cpp-and-winrt-apis/index.md) is the language projection that we recommend for developing UWP games with DirectX. C++/WinRT is a standard modern C++17 language projection for Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs. It supersedes Microsoft C++ with Component Extensions (C++/CX). For a code example, using C++/WinRT to call DirectX APIs, see [Full source code listing of a minimal Direct2D application](../cpp-and-winrt-apis/consume-com.md#full-source-code-listing-of-a-minimal-direct2d-application).
- Basic graphics programming terminology.
- Basic Windows programming concepts.
- Basic familiarity with the Direct3D 9 (or later) APIs.
