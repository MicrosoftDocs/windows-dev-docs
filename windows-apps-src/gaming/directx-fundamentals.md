# Fundamentals of DirectX programming

This section provides information about the basic blocks of DirectX programming.

2D graphics for DirectX games topic explains the use of 2D bitmap graphics and effects, and how to use them in your game using a combination of elements from both Direct2D and Direct3D libraries.

Direct3D graphics learning guide topic provides an overview of the concepts that Direct3D uses.

Basic 3D graphics for DirectX games topic explains the fundamental concepts of 3D graphics using a five-part tutorial that introduces the Direct3D concept and API. This tutorial shows you how to initialize Direct3D interfaces using Windows Runtime, apply per-vertex shader operations, set up the geometry, rasterize the scene, and cull hidden surfaces.

Load resources in your DirectX game topic guides you through the basic steps for loading meshes (models), textures (bitmaps), and compiled shader objects from local storage or other data streams for use in your UWP game.
