# Game broadcast and capture

This section provides information for adding game capture and broadcast capabilities to a UWP app.

## Game broadcasting
Currently, users must initiate game broadcasting using the system UI that is built into Windows, but starting with Windows 10, version 1709, apps can launch the system broadcasting UI and can receive notifications when broadcasting starts and stops. For more information, see [Manage game broadcasting](manage-game-broadcasting.md).

## Game capture
Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, UWP apps can record audio and video captures of gameplay, capture screenshots, and submit gameplay metadata to be embedded in captured and broadcast video streams, allowing your app and others to create dynamic experiences that are synchronized to gameplay events. For more information, see [Capture game audio, video, screenshots, and metadata](capture-game-audio-video-screenshots-and-metadata.md).
