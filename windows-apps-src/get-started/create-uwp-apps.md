# Tutorials

![Build your app](images/build-your-app.png)

Welcome to the UWP ([what's UWP again?](whats-a-uwp.md)) platform! Whether you're looking to get started with your first UWP app or are looking to use more advanced features, these tutorials will put you on the right track. You'll learn how to:

-   Create UWP projects in Microsoft Visual Studio.
-   Add UI elements and code to your project.
-   Use XAML, data binding, and other fundamental UWP elements.
-   Incorporate unique UWP features such as Ink and Dial into your app.
-   Use third party libraries to add new functionality.
-   Build and debug your app on your local machine.

## Ask a bot!

If you're stuck or need some help finding the right docs, try asking the experimental chat bot below. For example, ask 'Where can I download Visual Studio?' or 'Tell me about Fluent Design". If you don't get a useful answer, try rewording your query slightly.
