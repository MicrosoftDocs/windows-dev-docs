# Start coding

![Build your app](images/build-your-app.png)

Welcome to the [UWP platform](universal-application-platform-guide.md)! On this page, we'll point you at the right information you need to start coding the Windows 10 apps you want to create.

Before you begin development, you should be sure to [get set up.](get-set-up.md)

## Learning tracks

The following learning tracks show you what you need to know to complete some basic tasks, and where you can find that info. They aren't tutorials, but they provide reference code to ensure you're on the right track.

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Construct a form](construct-form-learning-track.md) | Learn how to create a form that's easy to use and looks good no matter the screen size. |
| [Display customers in a list](display-customers-in-list-learning-track.md) | Learn how to display and edit data in your UI. |
| [Save and load settings](settings-learning-track.md) | Learn how and where to save and retrieve settings. |
| [Work with files](fileio-learning-track.md) | Learn how to read from and write to files, and which folders you do and don't have access to. |

All our learning tracks are written for experienced devs who are getting familiar with Windows 10. If you're just beginning, start with our content for new developers.

## For new developers

If you're a new dev, Microsoft has many resources to teach you the basics of how to use the code and tools that you'll need for Windows 10 development.

* [Create a "Hello World" app](your-first-app.md)

If you want a more detailed walkthrough on the basics of coding, the C# language, Visual Studio, or the features of the Universal Windows Platform, you should check out the following resources:

**Docs:**

* [Get started with C#](/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/)
* [C# Quickstarts](/dotnet/csharp/quick-starts/)
* [Get started with Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/)

**Tutorials:**

* [Windows on Microsoft Learn](/learn/browse/?products=windows&resource_type=module)

## Using the docs

If you've already explored our learning tracks, or if you're interested in something they don't cover, you should take your own tour through our documentation. Here's a quick overview of what you can expect to find in each area:
