# Create your first app

Welcome to the [UWP platform](universal-application-platform-guide.md)! These tutorials will help you create your first UWP app in the language of your choice.

To get started, choose your favorite language.

## C# and XAML

Use your .NET, WPF, or Silverlight skills to build apps using C# with Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML).

* [A Developer's Guide to Windows 10](/learn/)

## C++/WinRT and XAML

Leverage your programming expertise in standard C++ to build apps using C++/WinRT with Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML).

## JavaScript and HTML

Take advantage of your web skills to build apps using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
