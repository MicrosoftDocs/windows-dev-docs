# Create your first app

## Write a UWP app using your favorite programming language

![Build your app](images/build-your-app.png)

Welcome to the UWP ([what's UWP again?](whats-a-uwp.md)) platform! These tutorials will help you create your first UWP app in the language of your choice. You'll learn how to:

-   Create UWP projects in Microsoft Visual Studio.
-   Add UI elements and code to your project.
-   Use Ink and the Dial in your apps.
-   Use third party libraries to add new functionality.
-   Build and debug your app on your local machine.

To get started, choose your favorite language!

## C# and XAML

Use your .NET, WPF, or Silverlight skills to build apps using XAML with C#.
