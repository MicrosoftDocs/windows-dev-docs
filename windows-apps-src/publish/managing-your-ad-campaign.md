# Manage your ad campaign


To manage ad campaigns for your app in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard), expand **Attract** in the left navigation menu and then select **Ad campaigns**. You'll see all of the ad campaigns associated with your apps, along with the impressions, clicks, and installs for each ad campaign. For more information about impressions, clicks, and installs, see the definitions for these terms in [Ad campaign report](promote-your-app-report.md).

To filter the list of ad campaigns, click the **Section filters** drop-down and choose from the following filters:

-   **Date**: This specifies the data range for impressions, clicks, and installs that are associated with the ad campaigns.
-   **Status**: This specifies the status of the ad campaigns:
    -   **Active** indicates that the ad campaign is running and processing data. To temporarily pause an ad campaign, click **Pause** in the **Action** column of the ad campaigns table.
    -   **Paused** indicates that the ad campaign is temporarily on hold and not processing data. To resume an ad campaign, click **Resume** in the **Action** column of the ad campaigns table.
    -   **Ended** indicates that the ad campaign has reached the end date you specified when you created or last modified the ad campaign.
    -   **Needs attention** indicates that the ad campaign has issues that need your attention, such as a billing failure or a custom ad design that failed validation. To fix the issues, click the text in the **Action** column of the ad campaigns table.
-   **Campaign type**: This specifies whether to display paid or [house](about-house-ads.md) ad campaigns.
