# Attract customers and promote your apps

Once your app is in the Microsoft Store, it's time to get it in front of as many customers as possible. [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) offers many features that help you promote your products and grow your customer base, including ad campaigns, promo codes, sale pricing, and more.
