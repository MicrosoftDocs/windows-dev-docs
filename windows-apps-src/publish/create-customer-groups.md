# Create customer groups

You can create *customer groups* that include a subset of your app's customers. These groups can be used to target customers for promotions, testing, and other purposes.

To view and create customer groups, expand **Engage** in the left navigation menu of [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard), then select **Customer groups**.

Currently, two types of customer groups are supported:

- **Segments.** These are dynamically-created groups of Windows 10 customers who meet the demographic or revenue criteria that you choose. Segments are typically used with [push notifications](send-push-notifications-to-your-apps-customers.md) or [targeted offers](use-targeted-offers-to-maximize-engagement-and-conversions.md). For more info, see [Create customer segments](create-customer-segments.md).
- **Known user groups.** These are groups of specific customers, created from the email addresses associated with their Microsoft accounts. Known user groups are most often used with [package flighting](package-flights.md) in order to deliver specific packages to customers in that group, or for distribution of a submission to a [private audience](choose-visibility-options.md#audience). For more info, see [Create known user groups](create-known-user-groups.md).
