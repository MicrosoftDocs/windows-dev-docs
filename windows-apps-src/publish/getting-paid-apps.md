# Getting paid
Here’s some important info you’ll need to ensure that you receive payment for your apps, add-ons, and advertising earnings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can receive money from app sales in the Microsoft Store, you need to [set up your payout account and and fill out the necessary tax forms](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md).

## Store fee

When you [sign up for a developer account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615100), you accept the [App Developer Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement). This agreement explains the relationship between you and Microsoft as it pertains to selling apps in the Microsoft Store, including the Store fee that Microsoft charges for every sale made.

In most cases, the Store fee is 30%. Fees are officially defined in the [App Developer Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement). Always review that document if you have any questions.

The Store fee is applied to all app sales collected by the Microsoft Store, including add-ons.


## Price tiers

The price tier(s) that you select sets the [sales price](set-and-schedule-app-pricing.md#base-price) in all the countries where you choose to distribute your app. You can also use additional pricing features such as  [choosing different prices for different markets](set-and-schedule-app-pricing.md#override-base-price-for-specific-markets) or [putting your app on sale](put-apps-and-add-ons-on-sale.md).

You can offer your app for free, or you can pick a price that customers must pay to acquire your app. Price tiers start at .99 USD, with additional increments (1.09 USD, 1.19 USD, and so on). The increments between price tiers increase as the price gets higher.

> [!NOTE] 
> These price tiers also apply to any add-ons that you offer from within your app.

Each price tier has a corresponding value in each of the currencies offered by the Store. We use these values to help you sell your apps at a comparable price point worldwide. However, due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the exact sales amount may vary slightly from one currency to another.

You also have the option to enter a free-form price of your choosing in a specific market’s local currency. When you do this, the price will not be adjusted (even if conversion rates change) unless you submit an update with a new price. 

Keep in mind that the price you select may include sales or value-added tax that your customers must pay. See [Tax details for paid apps](tax-details-for-paid-apps.md) for more info.


## Payout reporting

You can access details about your payment info and download reports in the **Payout summary** of the Windows Dev Center dashboard. For more about the info shown here, and how we categorize the money you earn, see [Payout summary](payout-summary.md).


## Payout timeframe

Payments are made on a monthly basis (provided the applicable payment threshold has been met and you haven’t placed your payout on hold as described below). We'll typically send any payment due in a given month by the 15th day of that month. Note that payments generally take between 3 to 10 additional business days to reach your payout account. For more info, see [Payment thresholds, methods, and timeframes](payment-thresholds-methods-and-timeframes.md).


##  Payout hold status

By default, we’ll send payments on a monthly basis as described above. However, you have the option to put your payouts on hold, which will prevent us from sending payments to your account. If you choose to put your payouts on hold, we’ll continue to record any revenue that you earn and provide the details in your **Payout summary**. However, we won’t send any payments to your account until you remove the hold. 

To place your payments on hold, go to **Account settings**. Under **Financial details**, in the **Payout hold status** section, toggle the slider to **On**. You can change your payout hold status at any time, but be aware that your decision will impact the next monthly payout. For example, if you want to hold April’s payout, make sure to set your payout hold status to **On** before the end of March.

Once you have set your payout hold status to **On**, all payouts will be on hold until you toggle the slider back to **Off**. When you do so, you’ll be included during the next monthly payout cycle (provided any applicable payment thresholds have been met). For example, if you’ve had your payouts on hold, but would like to have a payout generated in June, then make sure to toggle the payout hold status to **Off** before the end of May.

> [!NOTE]
> Your **Payout hold status** selection applies to **all** revenue sources that are paid through Windows Dev Center (Microsoft Store, advertising, Azure Marketplace, etc.). You cannot select different hold statuses for each revenue source.
