# Insights report


The **Insights** report in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) highlights significant changes (increases or decreases in a specific metric) that we detected over the last 30 days in your acquisitions, health, and/or usage data. This lets you get a quick look at potentially important changes without having to view all of the charts in each of these reports.

> [!NOTE]
> Data in this report covers the last 30 days. You can't select a different time period for this report.

The report sorts data into three tabs: **Acquisitions**, **Health**, and **Usage**. To see insights for one of these areas, select its tab.

Insights are shown when we detect a significant change in your data. For each insight, we'll show the following:
- **Insight type**: The area in which the insight was detected.
- **Value**: The specific metric which changed significantly (or **All** if the change applies to the entire **Insight type**).
- **Date**: The date on which we identified the change. This date represents the end of the week in which we detected a significant increase or decrease compared to the week before that.
- **Overall impact**: The percentage that the value increased or decreased across your entire customer base. This helps you understand how widespread the impact of a particular change may be, especially when comparing it to percentage info shown in **Top contributors.**
- **Top contributors**: If applicable, the specific segment, package, or other identifying factor to help understand which customers the change is related to. For example, a change may be detected primarily with customers from a specific market or on a certain device type. For **Health** data, this may include specific failure hashes or package versions. Where applicable, we'll also show the percentage that the value increased or decreased for that factor.
- **Action**:
   - Select **Show 14-day trend** to view a chart showing how the metric changed over the entire 14 days leading up to the insight date.
   - Select **Tell us if this is accurate** to give us your feedback and let us know if the insights we've provided seem accurate. This feedback will help us to continue to improve the data we provide here.
