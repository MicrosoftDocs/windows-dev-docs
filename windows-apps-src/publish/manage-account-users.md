# Manage account users

You can use Azure Active Directory to add and manage additional users in your [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard)  account. You can define the role or custom permissions that each user should have. You can also assign a role to a group of users, or to an Azure AD application.

In order to add and manage account users, you must first associate your Partner Center account with your organization's Azure Active Directory. 

This section describes how to do the following:

-   [Associate Azure Active Directory with your Partner Center account](./associate-azure-ad-with-partner-center.md)
-   [Add users, groups, and Azure AD applications to your Partner Center account](add-users-groups-and-azure-ad-applications.md)
-   [Set roles and custom permissions for account users](set-custom-permissions-for-account-users.md)

> [!TIP]
> These topics are specific to the Windows apps developer program in Partner Center, but associating a tenant and managing users works similarly for accounts in the Windows Hardware Developer Program (see [Dashboard Administration](/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/dashboard-administration) for more info) or in the Windows Desktop Application Program (see [Windows Desktop Application Program](/windows/desktop/appxpkg/windows-desktop-application-program#add-and-manage-account-users) for more info).
