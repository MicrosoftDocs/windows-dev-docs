# Manage account users

You can use Azure Active Directory to add and manage additional users in your Dev Center account. You can define the role or custom permissions that each user should have. You can also assign a role to a group of users, or to an Azure AD application.

In order to add and manage account users, you must first associate your Dev Center account with your organization's Azure Active Directory. 

This section describes how to do the following:

-   [Associate Azure Active Directory with your Dev Center account](associate-azure-ad-with-dev-center.md)
-   [Add users, groups, and Azure AD applications to your Dev Center account](add-users-groups-and-azure-ad-applications.md)
-   [Set roles and custom permissions for account users](set-custom-permissions-for-account-users.md)
