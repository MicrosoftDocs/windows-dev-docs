# Ad campaign report

The **Ad campaign** report in the Windows Dev Center dashboard lets you see how your app promotion ad campaigns are performing.

To see the report, expand **Attract** in the left navigation menu and select **Ad campaigns** (or, from within an app, expand **Monetization** and select **Promote your app**). 

## Definitions

This report shows data for the following items:

-   **Impressions**: The number of times your ad has been shown to customers.
-   **Clicks**: The number of times a customer has clicked on your ad.
-   **Conversions**: If your campaign objective is to increase installs of your app, a conversion is the number of times someone viewed your ad and then installed your app within 24 hours. If your campaign objective is to increase engagement in your app, a conversion is the number of times someone viewed your ad and then opened your app within 24 hours. See below for more information about install tracking and how conversions are measured.
-   **Spend**: The amount of money that you've spent on each campaign.

## Apply filters

At the top of the report, you can use the **Section filters** to adjust the scope of the data shown in the report:

-   **Date**: The default selection is **Last 30 days**, but you can choose to show data for 3, 6, or 12 months.
-   **Campaign objective**: You can show all campaigns, or limit the data to show only those whose objective is **App installs** or **App engagement**.
-   **App name**: The default selection is **All**, but you can choose to show campaigns for only a specific app.
-   **Campaign type**: You can show all campaign types, or limit the data to show only paid, house, or community ad campaigns.
-   **Status**: The default selection is **All**, but you can choose to show data only for campaigns that fall into a particular status (**Active**, **Draft**, **Paused**, **Ended**, or **Needs attention**).


## Ad campaign metrics

Near the top of the page, you'll see a list of your ad campaigns with the number of impressions, clicks, and conversions for each one, along with the total spend and any available actions. To edit a campaign, you can click its name from this list.

Toward the bottom of the page, you'll see these performance metrics displayed as lines plotted on a graph. Select the tab headers to view data for **Impressions**, **Clicks**, **Conversions**, or **Spend** as described above.

You can display performance data for up to six different ad campaigns at a time. Select **More campaigns** to choose which campaigns to display. You can also select the minus symbol by a displayed campaign to remove it from the chart.


## Install tracking

Running an install ad campaign through Dev Center provides much-needed exposure to advertise your apps. Ad impressions are shown to customers who are most likely to be interested in the app, and those customers can click on the ad and install the app from the Store. Previously, it was hard to distinguish between installs that were the result of an ad campaign versus installs that came from other sources.

This report shows you how many installs you've earned by running your ad campaigns. This only represents downloads that are a direct outcome of your ad campaigns, and does not include downloads from other sources.

By monitoring installs for your ad campaigns, you can measure the true return on investment from the money you spend on promoting your apps. It also helps you compare the cost of obtaining a new customer with the lifetime value of your customers.


## Measuring conversions

Ad campaigns deliver ad impressions within other apps. Customers who are exposed to the ad are likely to install the app in one of two ways: by clicking the ad or based on viewing the ad impression.

If a customer is shown an ad and he or she installs the app within 24 hours, either by clicking the ad or by going to the Store listing page of the app, that install is attributed to the campaign that delivered the impression.

An install is tracked in the Store across phone, tablet, PC, and other Windows 10 devices based on the customer who installed the app. The advertising engine tracks customers who see the ad and we use this information to correlate the customers who viewed the ad with the customers who installed the app. In order for the app install to be counted, a few requirements must be met:

1.  The customer has not opted out of targeting.
2.  The customer is logged in to a Microsoft account.
3.  The customer meets [COPPA](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=536558) requirements (customers that don't meet COPPA requirements cannot be tracked).

As a result, it is possible that app install tracking may underreport the actual number of installs generated by an ad campaign. Please note that you can view the total number of installs for an app (through campaigns and otherwise) in the [Acquisitions](acquisitions-report.md) report in Dev Center.


## Account billing history

To see all of the ad campaign transactions associated with your account, select **Billing history** in the left navigation menu.

For each transaction, we show the **Transaction date**, the appropriate **Campaign name**, the **Payment method** charged, **Payment ID**, **Billing start date**, **Billing end date**, **Total amount** of the charge, and **Payment status**. 

You can download your account billing history as a Microsoft Word document by clicking the **Download** link.
