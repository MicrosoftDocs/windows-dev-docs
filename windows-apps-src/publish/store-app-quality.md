# App Quality

Last updated: July 25, 2017

Microsoft Store offers customers worldwide a broad and diverse collection of apps. It’s important to customers and developers alike that apps in the Store are enjoyable, entertaining and worthwhile. To help developers hit that mark, we're providing this overview of some of the key aspects of app quality.

To help you keep current with the quality trends we’re seeing, we’ll update this page from time to time with additional information and fresh examples, based on what we’re seeing in the Store. Here’s our latest update on quality basics.


## Where to start

When starting out, begin with your customer in mind. Know what customers want and know what you want to give them. Build an app with multiple features and lasting value. Here are some tips to help you create a quality app:


## Metadata is key

The metadata on your Store page (icon, title, screenshots, and description) gives customers their first impression of the overall quality of your app. A clear Store page and organized app metadata will let users know what to expect before they download the app.

The **icon** is usually the first experience customers will have with your app. A great icon can make or break the split-second quality judgment they’ll make. What makes a good icon?

- Clarity, simplicity and uniqueness are the hallmarks of good icons.
- A good icon is instantly recognizable. Avoid fuzzy, distorted icons or ID-style photos.
- Text in icons can be hard to read; use it sparingly.
- Use your icon to stand out from the crowd and don’t copy existing app icons.

Make your **title** memorable and informative. A quality title can draw attention to your app.

- Be original and distinctive. For example, a title that’s a variation on the spelling of another app can cause confusion and a unique title can help your app stand out.
- Choose a title that is informative. For example, “My First App” or “Client App” are too generic.
- Take a look at the article [Choosing your app's name](./create-your-app-by-reserving-a-name.md#choosing-your-apps-name) for more helpful title ideas.

The **description** lets you describe your app’s main features. Keep it clear, crisp, and compelling.

- Use simple language and good grammar so customers in all your markets understand what your app does.
- Keep your description concise and meaningful so customers can easily tell what your app does. Avoid making customers read a long list. If your app needs a detailed explanation or scenario, include a link to your website.
- List app features in the features section of the metadata and summarize your best features in the app description so customers can tell what they’ll get. For example, don’t just list the planets when you describe your astronomy app; tell customers about your app’s special satellite tracking feature. In crowded segments of the Store, make an extra effort to tell customers how your app is different and better.
- Tell customers the truth. Describe what’s actually in the app. For example, don’t tell customers about features that aren’t yet in your app (unless you identify them as planned).
- If your app depends on another app to function, say so the beginning of your description. This will let customers know what other software and apps they need to use your app.
- For some great tips, see the article [Write a great app description](./write-a-great-app-description.md).

**Screenshots** and **Trailers** are your chance to give customers a preview of your app’s awesome functionality. Use them skillfully to highlight app quality:

- Show off actual app features. For example, if your app is a game guide or gameplay video, highlight your tremendous tips and tricks (just showing gameplay is confusing if your app isn’t a game).
- Show off your clean interface and the unique features of your app. For example, one screenshot doesn’t usually capture the full experience of your app; ten nearly identical screenshots aren’t helpful and provide a poor customer experience.
- Is your app available on multiple platforms? Great! But make sure your screenshots show customers the experience they’ll get on their Windows devices.
- Keep trailers to under a minute to hold customers’ attention and highlight the best of your app. Keep your trailers relevant and meaningful.


## Create amazing apps with staying power

If you want downloads to pay off, do something truly amazing, enjoyable, or useful.

- Provide lasting value. For example:
    - Does your cooking app include enough recipes to entice customers to use it more than once?
    - Is your sports team app regularly updated with current statistics or does it offer only a static collection of results?
    - Does your game offer interesting gameplay and different outcomes?
    - Is your guide or tutorial app worth more than a single use? Does it provide anything customers can’t find with a quick browser search?
    - Does your informational or RSS app offer more than just a collection of links? Does it provide organization, dynamic updates, or other features than distinguish make it more than a “favorites” list?
- Make it easy to use and appealing. The single biggest quality hallmark for users is UI. Quality UI is clean, simple, intuitive and consistent with the platform. Your UI can provide users transparent access to features, leveraging controls and conventions that users expect in their device platform. See [Design and UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design) for some great ideas.
- Add just one useful feature no one else offers, and you’ve given users a reason to keep this app and look for your other apps. To stand out, offer either a new type of app or new functionality in an existing type. Functionality is especially critical in crowded segments of the Store.
- Provide value and be generous. For example, if you build a cooking app, include enough recipes to entice customers to add your app to their devices. Similarly, an app that provides a static collection of sports results is more appealing when its regularly updated with current statistics.


## Check in

Customers value your attention to their feedback and needs. Satisfied customers can increase reviews and ratings of your app.

- Ask how your app is doing. Ask customers for ratings and reviews, and leave it to them to decide what rating to give.
- Earn your ratings. Quality developers solicit feedback, respond to bugs and feature requests, and actively update their apps.
