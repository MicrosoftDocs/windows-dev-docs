Keep in mind that there are certain requirements you need to follow when using these images; these requirements, along with usage examples and guidelines, are available in a PDF file.

## Device images

To promote your app, you may want to show how it looks when running on a Windows device. We have a variety of device chassis images for you to select from, including phones, tablets, laptops and PCs.

## License to Microsoft Marks

*Microsoft Marks* means the *Microsoft badge* described on the [badge generator](https://developer.microsoft.com/store/badges) page. To use these badges, you must:

-   If you are registered as an app developer in Partner Center, comply with the [“License to Microsoft Marks”](/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement#license_to_mark) section of the App Developer Agreement.

-   If you are not registered as an app developer in Partner Center, Microsoft grants you a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the badges solely as described in the Microsoft Store Badge Guidelines. Microsoft may change these guidelines, but if it does, Microsoft will use reasonable means to redirect you to any new URLs where these specifications are posted. Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.

-   Follow the logo usage specifications described in the [Microsoft Store Badge Guidelines](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/7/D/07DF43D4-B1A8-4D38-BC02-4903BB36CEE8/Microsoft_Store_Badge_Guidelines.pdf).
