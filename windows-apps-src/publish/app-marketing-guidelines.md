# Microsoft Store marketing guidelines for apps

Learn how to promote your apps and content in the Microsoft Store. These guidelines cover how to use the assets that are available to you, along with recommendations for promoting your apps in print, TV, social media and digital advertising.

## Store badges

We’ve created special promotional badges to help you drive more customers to your app's listing in the Microsoft Store. These badges are available in 44 languages. Keep in mind that there are certain requirements you need to follow when using these images; these requirements, along with usage examples and guidelines, are available in a PDF file.

## Badge generator and images

You can use our [badge generator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=534236) to generate HTML that displays the Store badge (in the language of your choice) and links directly to your app's Store listing.

You can also download the complete set of badge images (in PNG and PDF format) from the link below.

## Device images

To promote your app, you may want to show how it looks when running on a Windows device. We have a variety of device chassis images for you to select from, including phones, tablets, laptops and PCs. Best practices and technical specifications for how to use these images can be found in the [Microsoft Store Marketing Guidelines](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529769).

## License to Microsoft Marks

*Microsoft Marks* means the *Microsoft badge* described on the [badge generator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=534236) page. To use these badges, you must:

-   Have your app or other content available in the Microsoft Store, or be part of the [Microsoft Affiliate Program](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=624463).

-   If you are registered with Dev Center, comply with the [“License to Microsoft Marks”](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx#license_to_mark) section of the App Developer Agreement.

-   If you are not registered with Windows Dev Center, Microsoft grants you a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the badges solely as described in the Microsoft Store Badge Guidelines. Microsoft may change these guidelines, but if it does, Microsoft will use reasonable means to redirect you to any new URLs where these specifications are posted. Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.

-   Follow the logo usage specifications described in the [Microsoft Store Badge Guidelines](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529769).

Microsoft is the sole owner of the Microsoft Marks and associated goodwill, and the sole beneficiary of the goodwill associated with your use of the Microsoft Marks. Microsoft may revoke this license at any time and at its sole discretion.
