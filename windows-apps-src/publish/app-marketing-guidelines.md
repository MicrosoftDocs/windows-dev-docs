## Device images

To promote your app, you may want to show how it looks when running on a Windows device. We have a variety of device chassis images for you to select from, including phones, tablets, laptops and PCs. Best practices and technical specifications for how to use these images can be found in the [Windows Store Marketing Guidelines](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529769).

-   If you are not registered with Windows Dev Center, Microsoft grants you a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the badges solely as described in the Windows Store Marketing Guidelines. Microsoft may change these guidelines, but if it does, Microsoft will use reasonable means to redirect you to any new URLs where these specifications are posted. Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.
