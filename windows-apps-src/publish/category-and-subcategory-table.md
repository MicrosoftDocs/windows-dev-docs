# Category and subcategory table


Listing your app in the right category and subcategory helps customers find your app and understand more about it.

You must choose the category that best describes your app. You can optionally choose a subcategory, if available. If you're not sure which category or subcategory to use, or you can't find one that seems to be an exact fit, choose the one that you think customers are most likely to look at when trying to find apps like yours.

If you choose **Games** for your category, you are required to select at least one subcategory (called *genre* for games). You can choose as many genres as are appropriate for your game. Note that in order to publish a game to customers on Xbox, you must enable the [Xbox Live Creators Program](/gaming/xbox-live/get-started-with-creators/get-started-with-xbox-live-creators) or go through the [concept approval](../gaming/concept-approval.md) process). 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you publish the app in the **Games** category, you won't be able to pick a different category in a new submission; it must be continue to be published in the **Games** category (although you can change the genre selections in a new submission). Likewise, you can't choose the **Games** category when updating an app that you previously published in a different category.

For apps which are not games, you must choose one category, and can optionally choose from any subcategories that are available. You can't select more than one subcategory for apps which are not in the **Games** category. Only some categories have subcategories, and you can only use a subcategory if it belongs to the category you selected.

To change the category or subcategory of an app that's already in the Store (except for changing from **Games** to another category or vice versa), [create a new submission](app-submissions.md) and select the new category or subcategory.

## Categories and subcategories

The Microsoft Store organizes apps into the following categories and subcategories.
