# Category and subcategory table


Listing your app in the right category and subcategory helps customers find your app and understand more about it.

You are required to the category that best describes your app. You can optionally choose a subcategory, if available. (If you choose **Games** for your category, a subcategory (genre) is required.)

An app can only be listed in one category (and one subcategory, if available.) If you're not sure which category or subcategory to use, or you can't find one that seems to be an exact fit, choose the one that you think customers are most likely to look at when trying to find apps like yours.

To change the category or subcategory of an app that's already in the Store, [create a new submission](app-submissions.md) and select the new category or subcategory.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you publish the app in the **Games** category, you won't be able to pick a different category in a new submission. You also can't choose the **Games** category in an update to an app that you previously published in a different category.

The Windows Store organizes apps into the following categories and subcategories.

Only some categories have subcategories. Keep in mind that you can only use a subcategory if it belongs to the category you picked.
