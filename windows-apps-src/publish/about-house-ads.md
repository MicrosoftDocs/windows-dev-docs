# About house ads


You can create an ad to promote one of your apps in your other apps, for free. We call these *house ads*.

To set up a house ad, select **Free house campaign** as the **Campaign type** when you [create an ad campaign](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md). The ad will automatically be eligible to appear in any app of yours that meets the following criteria:

-   The app must be for the same device type as the advertised app.
-   The app must have at least one ad unit set up.

When a house ad for App A appears in App B, you will not be charged for the impression, nor will you receive revenue for displaying the ad in your App B ad unit. Paid ads have priority over house ads to appear in your ad units.

> **Note**  An individual end user will see any given house ad a maximum of five times per day.
