The first step is to create a **submission**.You can start your submission when your app is complete and ready to publish, or you can start entering info even before you have written a single line of code. The submission will be saved in your dashboard, so you can work on it whenever you're ready.After your app is published, you can publish an updated version by creating another submission in your dashboard. Creating a new submission lets you make and publish whatever changes are needed, whether you're uploading new packages or just changing details such as price or category. To create a new submission for an app, click **Update** next to the most recent submission shown on the App overview page.> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the documentation describes how to create an app submission on the Dev Center dashboard. Alternatively, you can use the [Windows Store submission API](../monetize/create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md) to automate app submissions.## App submission checklistHere are the details that you can provide when creating your app submission, with links to more info.Items that you are required to provide or specify are noted below. Some areas are optional, or have default values provided that you can change as desired.### Pricing and availability page| Field name                    | Notes                                       | For more info                                                             ||-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|| **Base price**                | Required                                    | [Base price](set-app-pricing-and-availability.md#base-price)              || **Free trial**                | Default: No free trial                      | [Adding trials and in-app purchases](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj193599)  || **Markets and custom prices** | Default: All possible markets, no custom pricing | [Define pricing and market selection](define-pricing-and-market-selection.md)              || **Sale pricing**              | Optional                                    | [Put apps and add-ons on sale](put-apps-and-add-ons-on-sale.md)                                       || **Distribution and visibility** | Default: Make this app available in the Store | [Distribution and visibility](set-app-pricing-and-availability.md#distribution-and-visibility) || **Organizational licensing**    | Default: Allow volume acquisition by organizations | [Organizational licensing options](organizational-licensing.md)                        || **Publish date**                | Default: Publish as soon as possible      | [Publish date](set-app-pricing-and-availability.md#publish-date)          |<span/>### App properties page| Field name                    | Notes                                       | For more info                                                             ||-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|| **Category and subcategory**  | Required                                    | [Category and subcategory table](category-and-subcategory-table.md)       || **System requirements**      | Optional                                    | [System requirements](enter-app-properties.md#system-requirements)      || **App declarations**          | Default: Customers can install this app to alternate drives or removable storage; Windows can include this app's data in automatic backups to OneDrive | [App declarations](app-declarations.md) |<span/>### Age ratings page| Field name                    | Notes                                       | For more info                          ||-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|| **Age ratings**               | Required                                    | [Age ratings](age-ratings.md)          |<span/>### Packages page| Field name                    | Notes                                  | For more info                          ||-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|| **Package upload control**    | Required (at least one package)        | [Upload app packages](upload-app-packages.md) || **Device family availability** | Default: based on your packages       | [Device family availability](upload-app-packages.md#device-family-availability) || **Gradual package rollout**   | Optional (for updates only)            | [Gradual package rollout](gradual-package-rollout.md) || **Mandatory update**          | Optional (for updates only)            | [Mandatory update](upload-app-packages.md#mandatory-update)<span/>### Store listingsYou'll need all the required info for at least one of the languages that your app supports.
