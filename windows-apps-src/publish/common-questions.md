### How much does it cost to run an ad for my app?

It’s really up to you, but remember: the more you spend, the more people will see your ad. The more people see your ad, the more clicks and installs you should get. Take a look at [this article](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md) for information about creating an ad campaign for your app.

### How can I increase the maximum monthly budget amount allowed for my ad campaign?

If you plan to spend more than $10,000 in a month on your ad campaigns, please contact [aiacare@microsoft.com](mailto:aiacare@microsoft.com). We will upgrade you to a premium account, which lets you spend up to $50,000 per campaign. A premium account also gives you additional capabilities, such as the ability to set campaign start and end dates and to specify a destination URL for your campaign.

### Can I run ads for one of my apps in my other apps?

Yes. We call these *house ads*, and you can run them free of charge. Check out [this article](about-house-ads.md) for more information about community ads.

### Can I cross-promote my app with apps from other developers in the Store?

Yes. We call these *community ads*, and you can run them free of charge. After you [opt-in to community ads](about-community-ads.md#opt-in-to-community-ads), you can [create a free community ad campaign](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md) and your app will share promotional ad space with other developers who also opt in to community ads. Check out [this article](about-community-ads.md) for more information.

### How can I customize my ad?

If you use one of the default ad templates, you can choose the size, imagery, and background color of your ad. You can also add a custom tag line to your ad if you want. Alternatively, you can upload your own ad designs that meet our requirements. For more information, see [Create an ad campaign for your app.](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md)

### Where will my ad appear?

Your ad will appear in apps that share your app's age rating and OS version. You set these properties when you publish your app in the Microsoft Store. For “Universal” campaigns, your ads will also appear within MSN.com, Outlook.com, Skype, and other Microsoft premium properties.

Ad campaigns are currently supported in these countries and regions:

Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam.

### What languages are supported for ad campaigns?

You can create ad campaigns in the following languages:

Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Spanish, Swedish.

### When will I be billed?

You will be billed each time your account accrues $50 of charges (or the equivalent amount in the local currency of your market or region) for all paid campaigns for your account.

If your account accrues less than $50 of charges in the 30-day period after your last billing date, you will be billed for those charges early in the following month. This helps to ensure that your account doesn’t maintain a running balance of ad campaign charges for more than a month.

If you don’t want to wait to be billed, you can pay your bill immediately by selecting **Charge now** on the **Billing summary** page (**Promotions** > **Billing history**). Your payment method will be charged the amount listed under **Unbilled amount**.

### How do I delete a credit card or edit the details of a credit card?

Go to [https://commerce.microsoft.com](https://commerce.microsoft.com), log in with your Microsoft account credentials, and make the necessary changes.
