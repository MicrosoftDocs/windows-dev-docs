# Manage account settings and profile info

You can view and update your developer account settings and profile info in the **Account settings** section of the [Windows Dev Center dashboard](using-the-windows-dev-center-dashboard.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> Notification preferences (such as which type of notifications to receive and how to receive them) can be managed in **Message Center** (which you can access by selecting the message icon near the top of your dashboard).

## Account settings

Select the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of your dashboard and then click **Account settings**. Here you'll find details about your account and links to other pages where you can view and/or update info and perform various account-related tasks.

In the **Account details** section, you can see the status and type of your account. You can also see your publisher ID info, including your Seller ID, Windows publisher ID, and Windows Phone publisher ID. These values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account. You cannot edit these values.

> [!NOTE]
> Identity details for your individual apps can be found in the [App identity](view-app-identity-details.md) page for each app.

## Contact info

The **Contact info** section displays info you provided when setting up your account. We use this info to contact you about your account. The publisher display name that we show to your customers in the Store also appears here.

You can edit this section if any of your contact info has changed. To do so, click **Update** (or select **Contact info** in the left navigation menu), make your changes, and then click **Save**.

Changing any of your contact info may require us to verify your account again, especially if you have a company account. Your verification status will return to **Pending** while this is in process. The verification process can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company from our verification partner Dun & Bradstreet.

Changing your publisher display name will also cause us to verify your account again. If you do this after you have published an app, you'll need to modify the publisher display name in your app's packages and submit the app again using the updated packages after your account has been reverified.



## Additional settings and info

Below are some of the other items you'll find in the **Account settings** section.

- **Verification status**: When your account is undergoing the verification process (for example, when you first sign up or if you significantly update your contact info), you can review your verification status here.
- **Dev Center Insider Program**: You can opt in or out of the [Dev Center Insider Program](dev-center-insider-program.md) from the main page of **Account settings**.
