# Payout reports

The **Payout summary** shows you details about the money you’ve earned with Microsoft. It also lets you know when you’ll receive payments and how much you'll be paid.

If you sell products in the Azure Marketplace, you’ll also see info on successful payouts in the **Payout summary**. For more details regarding Azure Marketplace payment, see the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Participation Policies](/legal/marketplace/participation-policy) and the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3ypvt).

> [!NOTE]
> To be eligible for payout, your proceeds must reach the [payment threshold](payment-thresholds-methods-and-timeframes.md) of $50. For details about the payment threshold see this page and review the app developer agreement.

## Export data page

Follow the instructions on this page to export the data you want.

Notes:

- The Export data page does not refresh on its own. You may need to refresh the page manually to see the most recent data.
- Your filter may result in a No data available error. This probably means you’ve left the default time period selected at three months, and then selected a Payment ID from an earning that’s outside of that period. Expand your time period and try again.

Transaction history from before July 1 2019 is handled separately. Statements will use the following fields instead of the current ones.

> [!NOTE]
> Legacy transaction history has a column called "Reserved" which corresponds to the "Earnings" column in the modern history, except that it excludes all earnings with status = "Payment Sent".

> [!NOTE]
> Filters (3M, 6M, 12M, etc.) will not apply to the **Historical statements** section.
