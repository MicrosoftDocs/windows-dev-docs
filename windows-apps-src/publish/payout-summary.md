# Payout summary


The **Payout summary** shows you details about the money you’ve earned with your apps and add-ons. It also lets you know when you’ll receive payments and how much you'll be paid.

If you use advertising to earn money, you'll see payment info for advertising proceeds in the **Payout summary**. We’ll show the app in which these proceeds were earned, or “unmapped” for ad units utilized in multiple apps or that otherwise can’t be mapped to a specific app. 

If you sell products in the Azure Marketplace, you’ll also see info on successful payouts in the **Payout summary**. For more details regarding Azure Marketplace payment, see the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Participation Policies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=722436) and the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=699560 ). More info about Azure Marketplace payout reporting can be found [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=722439).

> [!NOTE]
> To be eligible for payout, your proceeds must reach the applicable [payment threshold](payment-thresholds-methods-and-timeframes.md). If the proceeds are less than the payment threshold, they will remain in the **Reserved** category until the threshold has been met. For more details about the payment threshold for app proceeds, see the [App Developer Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement). For advertising proceeds, the payment threshold is $50 USD (or its equivalent in local currency). 
>
> Payments are made on a monthly basis (provided any applicable payment threshold has been met). We will typically send any payment due in a given month by the 15th day of that month. Note that payments generally take between 3 to 10 additional business days to reach your payout account. For more info, see [Payment thresholds, methods, and timeframes](payment-thresholds-methods-and-timeframes.md).

To view your **Payout summary**, click the **Payout** icon that appears near the upper right hand corner in Partner Center, then select **Payout summary**.

## Current proceeds and payments

Near the top of the page, you’ll find your **Current proceeds and payments**, which contains three sections: **Reserved**, **Upcoming payment**, and **Most recent payment**.

-   **Reserved** shows the amount of money your account has accumulated but which has not yet been scheduled for payment, including advertising proceeds. (Azure Marketplace proceeds do not appear in the **Reserved** section; if you only participate in the Azure Marketplace, you will see $0.00 here.) Proceeds from your most recent app sales remain in a pending state for about 30 days before they become eligible for payout. After that, the proceeds will be scheduled for payment the following month (assuming the [payment threshold](payment-thresholds-methods-and-timeframes.md) has been met). When a payment is attempted, your reserved balance will decrease by the payment amount and you will see the amount reflected in **Upcoming payment**. Note that the amount shown in **Reserved** is an estimate, because exchange rates for sales in other currencies may fluctuate prior to payment creation. You may notice your reserved balance change slightly at the beginning of every month. Your reserved balance is updated monthly to reflect monthly exchange rates, so that it represents a more accurate estimate. You can click **View details** to see additional information, or click the link to **Download your reserved transactions** to view a .csv file of all your **Reserved** transactions.
-   **Upcoming payment** shows the number of upcoming payments, the amount of your next payment(s), and the payment creation date(s). If your eligible proceeds haven’t met the [payment threshold](payment-thresholds-methods-and-timeframes.md) yet, no upcoming payment will be shown here. Select **View details** to see additional information, including the payment amount(s) and their respective revenue source. When an amount is shown in the **Upcoming payment** section, you'll see a temporary link to **Download transactions**.  If you click the link, you can view a .csv file of all the transactions that make up your upcoming payment(s).  Please note: when the **Upcoming payment** amount moves to **Most recent payment**, the **Download transactions** link will no longer appear.
-   **Most recent payment** shows the amount of the last payment attempted. If the payment was successful, the **View details** link will be blue, and you can click the link to see the details for each payment. Note that if we attempted to make multiple payments and only one of them was successful, only the amount of the successful payment will be shown here. If one or more payments failed, the **View details** link will be red and the number of failed payments will be displayed. You can click **View details** to see more details about the problem so that you can remedy the situation.

## Proceeds by app and adjustments


This section breaks down the summary info to let you see specifics by app. If you earned money through advertising, the total amount of your advertising proceeds is shown here as a single line item.

By reviewing this section, you can determine which apps have earned money that’s currently in the **Reserved** or **Most recent payment** category. You can also see the total amount you’ve received for each app. If it was necessary to make any [adjustments](#proceeds-by-app-and-adjustments) to your account balance, you can view them here too. (Note that adjustments for advertising proceeds are not currently shown here.)

## Payment statements


In this section you can view statements for all successful monthly payments and see the total amount of money you've been paid.

The **Total paid to date** section shows the total amount you've been paid for all your sales. Click **View details** to see the amounts that came from each revenue source.

Below the **Total paid to date** section, you will see your last three statements by default. To see the full statement (for successful payments), click **View**. You can access your historical payment statements through the drop-down box.

At the top of each statement, you’ll see the total amount of your monthly payment. Immediately below, in **Payments issued**, you’ll see a summary of how your payment amount was calculated.

Underneath, in the **Proceeds breakdown** section, you can view details on how much money was made per market and per revenue source (such as Microsoft Store, Windows Store 8, Windows Phone Store, etc.) by app. You’ll also see details on any [adjustments](#proceeds-by-app-and-adjustments) that were made, including the date, amount, and reason for the adjustment.

Note that the sections mentioned above only show info on your proceeds (and adjustments) from app sales; if you earned money through advertising, you’ll see a separate Microsoft Advertising section with details about the payouts and currency conversions.

## Adjustments

## Downloading payment transactions


At the top of each statement, you’ll see a link to **Download transactions**. Click this link to get a .csv file with detailed info about each of the transactions included in your payment.

The following table describes the fields that appear in the .csv file. Note that the exact fields you see may vary as we continue to update our reporting.
