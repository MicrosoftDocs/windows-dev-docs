# Account types, locations, and fees

We offer individual accounts and company accounts in many [countries and regions](#developer-account-and-app-submission-markets). Either type of account gives you access to publish apps to the Store and to participate in additional Microsoft developer programs.

> [!NOTE]
> When signing up for an account, make sure to sign in with the Microsoft account that you want to use for your developer account. You'll have the option to [add additional users to the account](manage-account-users.md) later.

When you [begin the signup process](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615100) you'll need to choose whether to create an individual account or a company account. Both types of accounts will allow you to submit apps, games, add-ins, and services.

Company accounts are intended for organizations and businesses. For company accounts, we require greater [verification](#account-verification) to confirm that you’re authorized to set up the account for your company. Individual accounts are usually appropriate for a single developer working on their own, although you have the option to add additional account users to either type of account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't change the account type once you make your selection, so be sure to choose the right type.

Here are the essential differences between the two account types.

| Individual account | Company account |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| <ul><li>Costs approximately $19 USD (one-time registration fee; the exact amount varies depending on your country or region)</li><li>Shorter account verification process</li></ul> | <ul><li>Costs approximately $99 USD (one-time registration fee; the exact amount varies depending on your country or region)</li><li>Requires greater account verification</li><li>Requires that your company is recognized as such in the country or region in which it is located</li><li>Able to submit apps with restricted functionality (as described in the [Microsoft Store Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/windows/agreements/store-policies#1014-account-type))</li></ul> |

Company accounts are a little more expensive, mostly because we take some additional steps to ensure that you are authorized to represent your company and set up the account. Per the [Store Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/windows/agreements/store-policies#1014-account-type), a company account is required to publish apps with certain functionality, such as apps that access financial account information or that require authentication to access primary functionality (without using a secure dedicated third party authentication provider).

## Account verification

After you've completed the signup process, your account will go through the verification process. For individual accounts, we check to make sure another company isn't already using your publisher display name. For company accounts, our verification partner Dun & Bradstreet will confirm that you’re authorized to create an account for the company that you’re representing. This process can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company (so make sure all of your contact information is up to date when you fill out the registration forms). You can't submit apps from a company account until it's been verified, but while you're waiting, you can [reserve an app name](create-your-app-by-reserving-a-name.md), access your Windows Dev Center dashboard, and continue building and testing your app.

You can check your verification status on the **Account settings** page. 


## Developer account and app-submission markets

You can register for your developer account and submit apps if you live or operate a business in a country or region listed below.

In the following table, the **Registration fee** is the current cost to register for your developer account. This is a one-time fee and there is no renewal charge. Note that the prices below are subject to change.

> [!NOTE]
> We'll add any applicable taxes and fees to the registration fee when you sign up. Also, when we pay you, your bank might charge a fee to receive the payment.

The **Payout** column describes how we'll [pay you](getting-paid-apps.md) the money you earn from your apps. You'll be able to choose the [payout account](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md) into which we'll deposit this money.

> [!NOTE]
> Some markets do not support paid apps (**payout**). In those markets, only free apps can be submitted.

The **PayPal** column indicates whether PayPal is a supported payment method that can be used for your [payout account](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md) (and, except where noted, for your developer account registration fee).
