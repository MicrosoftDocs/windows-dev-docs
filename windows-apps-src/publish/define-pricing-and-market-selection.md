# Define pricing and market selection


The Windows Store reaches customers in over 200 countries and regions around the world. You can choose the markets in which you'd like to offer your app, and you can determine the price to charge customers, with the option to customize prices on a per-market basis.

**Note**  Be sure to consider our [guidelines to help you globalize your app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh969150).

 

## Base price


When you select your app's **Base price**, that price will be used in every market where your app is sold, unless you specify a custom price for a particular market.

You can set the **Base price** to **Free**, or you can choose an available price tier. which sets the sales price in all the countries where you choose to distribute your app. Price tiers start at .99 USD, with additional tiers available at increasing increments (1.10 USD, 1.29 USD, and so on). The increments generally increase as the price gets higher.

> **Note**  These price tiers also apply to [add-ons](add-on-submissions.md).

Each price tier has a corresponding value in each of the more than 60 currencies offered by the Store. We use these values to help you sell your apps at a comparable price point worldwide. However, due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the exact sales amount may vary slightly from one currency to another.

Keep in mind that the price tier you select may include sales or value-added tax that your customers must pay. To learn more about your app’s tax implications in selected markets, see [Tax details for paid apps](tax-details-for-paid-apps.md). See also the [price considerations for specific markets](#price-considerations-for-specific-markets) below.

## Markets and custom prices


By default, your app will be listed in all possible markets, including any future markets that we may add later, at its base price.

To change these settings, expand the **Markets and custom prices** section on the **Pricing and availability** page of your app's submission. You can unselect individual markets to exclude them, or click **Unselect all**, then add individual markets of your choice.

> **Important**   It is your responsibility to meet any local legal requirements, even if those requirements aren't listed here or in the Windows Dev Center dashboard.

If you'd like to set custom prices for your app in specific markets, you can do that here as well; otherwise, by default, your app will be offered at its base price (in the local currency of that market).

> **Note**  You can also set custom prices for specific markets for [add-on submissions](add-on-submissions.md).

Keep in mind that even if you select all markets, local laws and restrictions or other factors may prevent certain apps from being listed in some countries and regions. Also, some markets may have specific requirements related to age ratings. If your app doesn’t meet these requirements, we won't be able to offer your app in that market. See [Age ratings](age-ratings.md) for more info.

> **Note**  For apps targeting Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, some individual markets are treated as one single "Rest of World" market. For more info, see ["Rest of World" markets for Windows 8.x](#rest-of-world-markets-for-windows-8x). Also keep in mind that customers on Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 will only see the app listed at its base price, even if you change the price in their market.

## Price considerations for specific markets


Payment methods such as gift cards and mobile operator billing can help increase sales of paid apps and in-app purchase items. Due to the higher costs to enable such payment methods, a Commerce Expansion Adjustment is added to the Store Fee deducted from Net Receipts to calculate the App Proceeds payable for paid apps and in-app purchase transactions in the countries/regions and using the payment methods in the tables below. You may want to consider if the Commerce Expansion Adjustment applies in a country/region where your app is available and factor that into your market pricing strategy. Details about the Commerce Expansion Adjustment can be found in the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058).

The Commerce Expansion Adjustment will be applied to all transactions processed for the specified Country/Region and Payment Methods as of the Effective Date. This information will be updated monthly; new countries/regions and payment methods will be listed within thirty (30) days after the Commerce Expansion Adjustment takes effect for that country/region and payment method.

## "Rest of World" markets for Windows 8.x


If your app includes packages targeting Windows 8.x, it's important to be aware that a number of markets are treated as a single "Rest of World" market for customers using the Store on Windows 8.x, even though they are now shown as individual markets in the Windows Dev Center dashboard (as opposed to the earlier Windows Store dashboard, where there was one selectable "Rest of World" market option).

If you leave the default selection when submitting your app, you don't have to worry about this, and your app will be available to all possible markets. However, if you want to exclude certain markets, keep in mind that excluding even one of these "Rest of World" markets means that your app won't be available in any of the "Rest of World" markets for customers on Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.

The markets that are included in "Rest of World" for Windows 8.x are the following:

-   Afghanistan
-   Åland Islands
