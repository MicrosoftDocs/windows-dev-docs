# Create app Store listings for your MSI or EXE app

> [!NOTE]
> MSI and EXE support in the Microsoft Store is currently in a limited public preview phase. As the size of the preview expands, we'll be adding new participants from the wait list. To join the wait list, click [here](https://aka.ms/storepreviewwaitlist).

The Store listings section of the app submission process is where you provide the text and images that customers will see when they view your app's listing in the Microsoft Store.

Many of the fields in a Store listing are optional, but we suggest providing multiple images and as much info as possible to make your listing stand out. The minimum required for the Store listings step to be considered complete is a text description and at least one screenshot.

## Manage Store listing languages

You must complete the Store listing page for at least one language. We recommend providing a Store listing in each language that your packages support, and you also have flexibility to create Store listings in additional languages which are not supported by your packages and not support languages for which you do not wish to provide a Store listing.

To add or remove languages for your Store listings, click Add/remove languages from Manage Store listings page.

When you have finished making your selections, click Save to return to the application overview page.

The Manage Store listings page of the app submission process is where you can also publish your app. By default, we'll publish your submission as soon as it passes certification. As your submission passes certification, you can view certification status on the Application Overview page.

## Add and edit Store listing info

To edit a Store listing, select the language name from the Store listings overview page. You must edit each language separately.

**Description**<br>*Required*<br>*Character limit: 10,000 characters*

The description field tells customers what your app does. See [Writing a great app description](../write-a-great-app-description.md) for more information.

**What's new in this version**<br>*Character limit: 1,500 characters*

If this is the first time you're submitting your app, leave this field blank. For an update to an existing app, this is where you can let customers know what's changed in the latest release.

**Product features**<br>*Character limit: 200 per feature*<br>*Feature limit: 20*

These are short summaries of your app's key features. They are displayed to the customer as a bulleted list in the Features section of your app's Store listing, in addition to the Description.

> [!NOTE]
> The store automatically displays each feature in a bulleted list. Do not add bullets manually.

**Screenshots**<br>*Required: 1*<br>*Recommended: 4+*<br>*Maximum: 10*

Screenshots are images of your app that are displayed to your customers in your app's Store listing. 

Each screenshot must be a .png file in either landscape or portrait orientation, and the file size cannot be larger than 50 MB. 

Size requirements: 1366 x 768 pixels or larger. Supports 4K images (3840 x 2160). (Will also be shown to customers on Surface Hub devices.) 

Note that if you create Store listings for multiple languages, you'll have a Store listing page for each one. You'll need to upload images for each language separately (even if you are using the same images). 

**Store logos**<br>*Required: 1:1 box art*<br>*Recommended: 2:3 poster art*

Store logos are optional images that you can upload to enhance the way your app is displayed to customers.

You can provide these images as .png files (no greater than 50 MB).

*1:1 box art (1080 x 1080 or 2160 x 2160 pixels)*

This is used as the main logo image for customers, so we require providing this image to ensure proper display. This image should include your app’s name.

*2:3 Poster art (720 x 1080 or 1440 x 2160 pixels)*

This image may appear in search results or in editorially curated collections. 

## Supplemental fields

The fields in this section are all optional, although a short description is recommended for all apps. Review the info below to determine if providing this info makes sense for your submission. The other fields may help provide an optimal experience for your product in different scenarios.

**Short description**<br>*Recommended*<br>*Character limit: 1,000*

A shorter, catchy description that may be used in the top of your product’s Store listing.

If no short description is provided, the store will use the first 100 characters of the first paragraph of your app's description instead. Because your description also appears below this text, we recommend providing a short description with different text so that your Store listing is not repetitive.

Short descriptions can be up to 1,000 characters, but some store views display only the first 270 characters (along with a link to view the entire short description). For best results, keep your short description under 270 characters.

**Additional system requirements**<br>*Character limit: 200 per feature*<br>*Feature limit: 11*

Specify any additional system requirements not listed on the [App properties page](enter-app-properties.md).

This field is especially important if your app requires hardware that might not be available on every computer. For instance, if your app requires a 3D printer or a wearable device, enter those requirements here. The info you enter will be shown to customers viewing your app's Store listing, along with the requirements you indicated on the product's properties page.

> [!NOTE]
> The store automatically displays each feature in a bulleted list. Do not add bullets manually.

## Additional information

**Search terms**<br>*Character limit: 30 per search term*<br>*Search term limit: 7*

Search terms are single words or short phrases that help make your app discoverable in the Store when customers search using those terms. They are not displayed to customers.

When adding search terms, think about the words that customers might use when searching for apps like yours, especially if they're not part of your app's name. Only use search terms that are relevant to your app.

> [!WARNING]
> In addition to the search term and character limits described above, you cannot use more than 21 unique words across all of your search terms.

**Copyright and trademark info**<br>*Character limit: 200*

Enter any copyright or trademark info that applies to your app here.

**Applicable license terms**<br>*Character limit: 10,000

Enter license terms for your app to be licensed to customers. License terms will be displayed as plain text in the store.

You can enter a single url in this field instead of your license text. If you do, the store will display the url as link to a page that contains your applicable license terms. This is useful if your applicable license terms are very long, or if you want to include clickable links or formatting in your applicable license terms.

**Developed by**<br>*Character limit: 255*

Enter text here if you want to include a Developed by field in your app's Store listing.

This value will not be displayed in the **Published by** field; that field always displays the publisher's display name.
