# Dev Center Insider Program

As a [registered developer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615100), you can help influence the functionality we make available in the Dev Center dashboard by joining the Dev Center Insider Program. This program allows you to try out new features before they become available to all developers. We encourage you to give us your feedback on these features by using the Feedback link in the bottom right corner of Dev Center. All of the feedback we receive from Dev Center Insiders will be read closely and given priority consideration.

To join the program, opt in on the **Account settings** page in your Dev Center dashboard. You can opt out at any time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The terms of the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx) apply to your participation in the program. Please read them, particularly Exhibit I, before you join the program. Keep in mind that the features made available exclusively to people in the Dev Center Insider Program may include experimental and early prerelease services. This means that these features often don’t have documentation available yet, and you may experience unintended results when using them.

Here are some of the features that we’ve made available exclusively to members of the Dev Center Insider Program. This list will change over time as new features are added (and as features introduced to the Insider Program are made available to everyone).

| Dev Center Insider Program feature   | How Dev Center Insiders can try it | Date added |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|
|**Customize your notification preferences**: Choose which notifications you receive about your Dev Center account and specify whether to receive them by email, in the dashboard, or both. | Use the icon near the top of your dashboard to go to **Message Center**, then select **Settings**. Make your selections in the Notification preferences section. You can also specify the address to use when we send email notifications.  | November 2017 |
|**View more details from your overview page**: Get more details on highlighted apps without leaving your overview page. | On the overview page, look for the boxes highlighting key statistics for your apps. Click any of the boxes to see more details about that app. | September 2017 |
|**Near real time health data**: The **Health** report now shows data for crashes, hangs, memory failures, and JavaScript exceptions in near real time when using the **72H** page filter option.  | In an app’s Health report, choose the **72H** option at the top of the page. Note that you may see a discrepancy in data for the 72 hour period when comparing the **72H** and **30D** filters. This is a known issue that we’re working to resolve.  | September 2017|
|**Cohort active usage analytics**: Track week-by-week usage for cohorts (groups of active users who started using your app in the same week) for insights into usage trends.  | In the **Usage** report, view the **Cohorts by active usage** chart.  |July 2017|
|**New usage-based options for customer segments**: Create segments of your customers based on how much they’ve been using your app. | In the **Engage** section, select **Customer groups** to create a new segment. In the inclusion conditions section, select **Usage** in the first drop-down, then choose one of the new options: **Engagement minutes**, **User sessions**, **Date first used** or **Date last used**. |July 2017|
|**Churn prediction option for customer segments**: Create a segment of your customers based on whether we detect that they’re likely to stop using your app soon.  | In the **Engage** section, select **Customer groups** to create a new segment. In the inclusion conditions section, select **Churn prediction** in the first drop-down, then choose **true** or **false** to define your segment. |May 2017|
|**Email notification for analytic trend changes**: Get notified about significant changes in your apps' acquisitions. | If we detect a significant change in an app's acquisition numbers compared to its historical data, we'll automatically send you an email. |April 2017|
|**Real time analytics**: See details about your app's most recent acquisitions and add-ons. The new report uses real-time event collection from your Windows 10 customers. | Choose **Real time report** in the left menu under **Analytics**. Select the time range to review data over the last 7 days or up to the last hour on a per-minute basis. Note that the report includes only data from customers on Windows 10.  |August 2016|
