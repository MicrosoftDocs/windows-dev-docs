# Install apps with the WinAppDeployCmd.exe tool


Windows Application Deployment (WinAppDeployCmd.exe) is a command line tool that can use to deploy a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app from a Windows 10 PC to any Windows 10 device. You can use this tool to deploy an app package when the Windows 10 device is connected by USB or available on the same subnet without needing Microsoft Visual Studio or the solution for that app. You can also deploy the app without packaging first to a remote PC or Xbox One. This article describes how to install UWP apps using this tool.

You just need the Windows 10 SDK installed to run the WinAppDeployCmd tool from a command prompt or a script file. When you install an app with WinAppDeployCmd.exe, this uses the .appx/.msix file or AppxManifest(for loose files) to side-load your app onto a Windows 10 device. This command does not install the certificate required for your app. To run the app, the Windows 10 device must be in developer mode or already have the certificate installed.

To deploy to mobile devices, you must first create a package. For more information, see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/packaging-uwp-apps).

The **WinAppDeployCmd.exe** tool is located here on your Windows 10 PC: **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\<SDK Version>\\x86\\WinAppDeployCmd.exe** (based on your installation path for the SDK). 
> [!NOTE]
> In version 15063 and later of the SDK, the SDK is installed side by side within version-specific folders.  Previous SDKs (prior to and including 14393) are written directly to the parent folder.

First, connect your Windows 10 device to the same subnet or connect it directly to your Windows 10 machine with a USB connection. Then use the following syntax and examples of this command later in this article to deploy your UWP app:

## WinAppDeployCmd syntax and options

This is the general syntax used for **WinAppDeployCmd.exe**:
```syntax
WinAppDeployCmd command -option <argument>
```

Here are some additional syntax examples for using various commands:
```syntax
WinAppDeployCmd devices
WinAppDeployCmd devices <x>
WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -ip <address>
WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -guid <address> -pin <p>
WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -ip <address> -dependency <a> <b> 
WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -guid <address> -dependency <a> <b>
WinAppDeployCmd uninstall -file <path>
WinAppDeployCmd uninstall -package <name>
WinAppDeployCmd update -file <path>
WinAppDeployCmd list -ip <address>
WinAppDeployCmd list -guid <address>
WinAppDeployCmd deployfiles -file <path> -remotedeploydir <remoterelativepath> -ip <address>
WinAppDeployCmd registerfiles -remotedeploydir <remoterelativepath> -ip <address>
WinAppDeployCmd addcreds -credserver <server> -credusername <username> -credpassword <password> -ip <address>
WinAppDeployCmd getcreds -credserver <server> -ip <address>
WinAppDeployCmd deletecreds -credserver <server> -ip <address>
```

You can install or uninstall an app on the target device, or you can update an app that's already installed. To keep data or settings saved by an app that's already installed, use the **update** options instead of the **install** options.

## WinAppDeployCmd.exe examples

Here are some examples of how to deploy from the command-line using the sytax for **WinAppDeployCmd.exe**.

Shows the devices that are available for deployment. The command times out in 3 seconds.

``` syntax
WinAppDeployCmd devices 3
```

Installs the app from MyApp.appx package that is in your PC's Downloads directory to a Windows 10 device with an IP address of 192.168.0.1 with a PIN of A1B2C3 to establish a connection with the device

``` syntax
WinAppDeployCmd install -file "Downloads\MyApp.appx" -ip 192.168.0.1 -pin A1B2C3
```

Uninstalls the specified package (based on its full name) from a Windows 10 device with an IP address of 192.168.0.1. You can use the list command to see the full names of any packages that are installed on a device.

``` syntax
WinAppDeployCmd uninstall -package Company.MyApp_1.0.0.1_x64__qwertyuiop -ip 192.168.0.1
```

Updates the app that is already installed on the Windows 10 device with an IP address of 192.168.0.1 using the specified app package.

``` syntax
WinAppDeployCmd update -file "Downloads\MyApp.appx" -ip 192.168.0.1
```

Deploys the files of an app to a PC or Xbox with an IP address of 192.168.0.1 in the same folder as the AppxManifest to the app1_F5 directory under the deployment path of the device.

``` syntax
WinAppDeployCmd deployfiles -file "C:\apps\App1\AppxManifest.xml" -remotedeploydir app1_F5 -ip 192.168.0.1
```

Registers the app at the app1_F5 directory under the deployment path of the PC or Xbox at 192.168.0.1.

``` syntax
WinAppDeployCmd registerfiles -file app1_F5 -ip 192.168.0.1
```

## Using WinAppDeployCmd to set up Run from PC deployment on Xbox One

Run from PC allows you to deploy a UWP application to an Xbox One without copying the binaries over, instead the binaries are hosted on a network share on the same network as the Xbox.  In order to do this, you need a developer unlocked Xbox One, and a loose file UWP application on a network drive that the Xbox can access.

Run this to register the app:
``` syntax
WinAppDeployCmd registerfiles -ip <Xbox One IP> -remotedeploydir <location of app> -username <user for network> -password <password for user>

ex. WinAppDeployCmd register files -ip 192.168.0.1 -remotedeploydir \\driveA\myAppLocation -username admin -password A1B2C3
```
