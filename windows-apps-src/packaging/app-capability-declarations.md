# App capability declarations

\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Capabilities must be declared in your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app's [package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211474) to access certain API or resources like pictures, music, or devices like the camera or the microphone.

You request access to specific resources or API by declaring capabilities in your app's [package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211474). You can declare general capabilities by using the [Manifest Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/br230259.aspx) in Microsoft Visual Studio, or you can add them manually. For more information, see [How to specify capabilities in a package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211477). It is important to know that when customers get your app from the Store, they're notified of all the capabilities that the app declares. Avoid declaring capabilities that your app doesn't need.

Some capabilities provide apps with access to a *sensitive resource*. These resources are considered sensitive because they can access the user's personal data or cost the user money. Privacy settings, managed by the Settings app, let the user dynamically control access to sensitive resources. Thus, it's important that your app doesn't assume a sensitive resource is always available. For more info about accessing sensitive resources, see [Guidelines for privacy-aware apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Hh768223). Capabilities that provide apps with access to a *sensitive resource* are annotated by an asterisk (\*) next to the capability scenario.

This article reviews four categories of capabilities described below.

-   General-use capabilities that apply to most common app scenarios.

-   Device capabilities that allow your app to access peripheral and internal devices.

-   Special-use capabilities that require a special company account for submission to the Store to use them. For more info about company accounts, see [Account types, locations, and fees](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/JJ863494).

-   Restricted capabilities that are only available to Microsoft and its partners.

## General-use capabilities

General-use capabilities apply to the most common app scenarios.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Music**\* | The **musicLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Music, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in jukebox apps that make use of the entire Music library.<br /><br />The [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **musicLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the **file picker**.<br /><br /> The **musicLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below. <table><thead><tr><th>XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="musicLibrary"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
| **Pictures**\* | The **picturesLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Pictures, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in photo apps that make use of the entire Pictures library.<br /><br />The [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **picturesLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized them by using the **file picker**.<br /><br />The **picturesLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<table><thead><tr><th>XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="picturesLibrary"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
| **Videos**\* | The **videosLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Videos, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in movie-playback apps that make use of the entire Videos library.<br /><br />The [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **videosLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the **file picker**.<br /><br />The **videosLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<table><thead><tr><th>XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="videosLibrary"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
| **Removable Storage** | The **removableStorage** capability provides programmatic access to files on removable storage, like USB keys and external hard drives, filtered to the file-type associations declared in the package manifest. For example, if a document-reader app declares a .doc file-type association, it can open .doc files on the removable storage device, but not other types of files. Be careful when you declare this capability, because users may include a variety of info in their removable storage devices, and will expect your app to provide a valid justification for programmatic access to the removable storage for all files of the declared type.<br /><br />Users will expect your app to handle any file associations that you declare. So don't declare file associations that your app cannot handle responsibly. The [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app.<br /><br />Declare the **removableStorage** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847).<br /><br />The **removableStorage** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<table><thead><tr><th>XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="removableStorage"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
| **Internet and public networks**\* | There are two capabilities that provide different levels of access to the Internet and public networks.<br /><br />The **internetClient** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Cannot act as a server. No local network access.<br />The **internetClientServer** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Can act as a server. No local network access.<br /><br />Most apps that have a web service component will use **internetClient**. Apps that enable peer-to-peer (P2P) scenarios where the app needs to listen for incoming network connections should use **internetClientServer**. The **internetClientServer** capability includes the access that the **internetClient** capability provides, so you don't need to specify **internetClient** when you specify **internetClientServer**.
| **Homes and work networks**\* | The **privateNetworkClientServer** capability provides inbound and outbound access to home and work networks through the firewall. This capability is typically used for games that communicate across the local area network (LAN), and for apps that share data across a variety of local devices. If your app specifies **musicLibrary**, **picturesLibrary**, or **videosLibrary**, you don't need to use this capability to access the corresponding library in a Home Group. On Windows, this capability does not provide access to the Internet.
| **Appointments** | The **appointments** capability provides access to the user’s appointment store. This capability allows read access to appointments obtained from the synced network accounts and to other apps that write to the appointment store. With this capability, your app can create new calendars and write appointments to calendars that it creates.<br /><br />The **appointments** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<table><thead><tr><th>XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="appointments"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
| **Contacts**\* | The **contacts** capability provides access to the aggregated view of the contacts from various contacts stores. This capability gives the app limited access (network permitting rules apply) to contacts that were synced from various networks and the local contact store.<br /><br />The **contacts** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<table><thead><tr><th>XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="contacts"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

| **Background Media Playback** | The **backgroundMediaPlayback** capability changes the behavior of the media-specific APIs like the [**MediaPlayer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.media.playback.mediaplayer.aspx) and [**AudioGraph**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.audiograph.aspx) classes to enable media playback while your app is in the background. All active audio streams will no longer mute, but will continue to be audible when an app transitions to the background. Additionally, app lifetime will be extended automatically while playback is occurring.
| **Remote System** | The **remoteSystem** capability allows apps to have access to a list of devices associated with the user's Microsoft Account. Access to the device list is necessary to perform any operations that persist across devices. This capability is required to access to all members of the following.<br /><br />Windows.System.RemoteSystems namespace<br />Windows.System.RemoteLauncher namespace<br />AppServiceConnection.OpenRemoteAsync method |
| **Spatial Perception** | The **spatialPerception** capability provides programmatic access to spatial mapping data, giving mixed reality apps information about surfaces in application-specified regions of space near the user.  Declare the spatialPerception capability only when your app will explicitly use these surface meshes, as the capability is not required for mixed reality apps to perform holographic rendering based on the user’s head pose. |

## Device capabilities

Device capabilities allow your app to access peripheral and internal devices. Device capabilities are specified by using the **DeviceCapability** element in your app package manifest. This element may require additional child elements and some device capabilities need to be added to the package manifest manually. For more info, see [How to specify device capabilities in a package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263092) and [**DeviceCapability Schema reference**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211430).

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Location**\* | The **location** capability provides access to location functionality that is retrieved from dedicated hardware like a GPS sensor in the PC or is derived from available network info. Apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled location services from the **Settings** charm. |
| **Microphone** | The **microphone** capability provides access to the microphone’s audio feed, which allows the app to record audio from connected microphones. Apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled the microphone from the **Settings** charm. |
| **Proximity** | The **proximity** capability enables multiple devices in close proximity to communicate with one another. This capability is typically used in casual multi-player games and in apps that exchange information. Devices attempt to use the communication technology that provides the best possible connection, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and the Internet. This capability is used only to initiate communication between the devices. |
| **Webcam** | The **webcam** capability provides access to the video feed of a built-in camera or external webcam, which allows the app to capture photos and videos. On Windows, apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled the camera from the **Settings** charm.<br/>The **webcam** capability only grants access to the video stream. In order to grant access to the audio stream as well, the **microphone** capability must be added. |
| **USB** | The **usb** device capability enables access to APIs in the [Updating the app manifest package for a USB device](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302259). |
| **Human interface device (HID)** | The **humaninterfacedevice** device capability enables access to APIs in the [How to specify device capabilities for HID](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263091). |
| **Point of Sevice (POS)** | The **pointOfService** device capability enables access to APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.PointOfService**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn298071) namespace. This namespace lets your app access Point of Service (POS) barcode scanners and magnetic stripe readers. The namespace provides a vendor-neutral interface for accessing POS devices from various manufacturers from a UWP app. |
| **Bluetooth** | The **bluetooth** device capability allows apps to communicate with already paired bluetooth devices over both Generic Attribute (GATT) or Classic Basic Rate (RFCOMM) protocol.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263413) namespace. |
| **Wi-Fi Networking** | The **wiFiControl** device capability allows apps to scan and connect to Wi-Fi networks.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.WiFi**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn975224) namespace. |
| **Radio state** | The **radios** device capability allows apps to toggle the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios.<br/>This capability is required to use the APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Radios**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn996447) namespace.  |
| **Optical disc** | The **optical** device capability allows apps to access functions on optical disk drives such as CD, DVD, and Blu-ray.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Custom**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263667) namespace. |
| **Motion activity** | The **activity** device capability allows apps to detect the current motion of the device.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Sensors**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR206408) namespace. |
| **Serial communication** | The **serialcommunication** device capability provides access to APIs in the Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication namespace, which allows a Windows app to communicate with a device that exposes a serial port or some abstraction of a serial port. This capability is required to use the APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.SerialCommnication**](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.devices.serialcommunication) namespace. |

## Special and restricted capabilities

There are cases where such capabilities are necessary and appropriate, such as banking with two-factor authentication, where users provide a smart card with a digital certificate that confirms their identity. Other apps may be designed primarily for enterprise customers and may need access to corporate resources that cannot be accessed without the user’s domain credentials.

Apps that declare special-use capabilities require a company account to submit them to the Store. In contrast, restricted capabilities do not require a special company account for the Store. Restricted capabilities are available for developers to use in their app, but require approval for store submission. For more information about company accounts, see [Account types, locations, and fees](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/JJ863494).

All restricted capabilities must include the **rescap** namespace when you declare them in your app's package manifest differently than other capabilities. The following example shows you how to declare the **appCaptureSettings** capability.

```xml
<Capabilities>
    <rescap:Capability Name="appCaptureSettings"/>
</Capabilities>
```

You must also add the **xmlns:rescap** namespace declaration in the top of the Package.appxmanifest file as shown below.

```xml
<Package
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10"
    xmlns:mp="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/2014/phone/manifest"
    xmlns:uap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10"
    xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities"
    IgnorableNamespaces="uap mp wincap rescap">
```
**Important**  
Special and restricted capabilities are intended for very specific scenarios. The use of these capabilities is highly restricted and subject to additional Store onboarding policy and review. Follow the steps below to request access to a restricted capability before submitting your app to the store. Note that you can sideload apps with restricted capabilities specified in the app package manifest without any restrictions. 
1. Determine if you are eligible to submit your app to the store with a specific restricted capability by looking at the table below. If you are not eligible, any requests you make will be denied.
2. If you are eligible visit the [Windows Developer support page](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/support).
3. Under Contact Us, select the Issue Type **Applications** and then Subcategory **Other**.
4. Include the capability you are requesting access to and include a reason for your request. If you do not provide all the information necessary, your request will be denied. You may also be asked to provide more information.

**Note** We will be reviewing requests on a case-by-case basis, which will take 5 business days or longer to respond. We highly recommend you submit your request well in advance of submitting your app to the store.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Enterprise** | Windows domain credentials enable a user to log into remote resources using their credentials, and act as if a user provided their user name and password. The **enterpriseAuthentication** special capability is typically used in line-of-business apps that connect to servers within an enterprise. <br /><br />You don't need this capability for generic communication across the Internet.<br /><br />The **enterpriseAuthentication** special capability is intended to support common line-of-business apps. Don't declare it in apps that don't need to access corporate resources. The [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847) provides a robust UI mechanism that enables users to open files on a network share for use with an app. Declare the **enterpriseAuthentication** special capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access, and you cannot realize them by using the **file picker**.<br /><br />The **enterpriseAuthentication** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br /><div class="code"><span codelanguage="XML"></span><table><colgroup><col width="100%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left">XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="left"><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="enterpriseAuthentication"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div>The **enterpriseDataPolicy** capability allows apps to define and use enterprise-specific policies for the device. This capability is required to use all members of the following classes.<ul><li>[**FileProtectionManager**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn705151)</li><li>[**DataProtectionManager**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn706017)</li><li>[**ProtectionPolicyManager**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn705170)</li></ul><br /><br />Anyone may request access to this capability for store submission.</td></tr>
| **Shared user certificates** | The **sharedUserCertificates** special capability enables an app to add and access software and hardware-based certificates in the Shared User store, such as certificates stored on a smart card. This capability is typically used for financial or enterprise apps that require a smart card for authentication.<br /><br />The **sharedUserCertificates** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br /><div class="code"><span codelanguage="XML"></span><table><colgroup><col width="100%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left">XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="left"><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="sharedUserCertificates"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br />No one may request access to this capability for store submission.
|**Documents**\* | The **documentsLibrary** special capability provides programmatic access to the user's Documents, filtered to the file type associations declared in the package manifest, to support offline access to OneDrive. For example, if a DOC reader app declared a .doc file type association, it can open .doc files in Documents, but not other types of files. <br /><br />Apps that declare the **documentsLibrary** special capability can't access Documents on Home Group computers. The [file picker](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Hh465174) provides a robust UI mechanism that enables users to open files for use with an app. Declare the **documentsLibrary** special capability only when you cannot use the file picker.<br /><br />To use the **documentsLibrary** special capability, an app must:<ul><li>Facilitate cross-platform offline access to specific OneDrive content using valid OneDrive URLs or Resource IDs</li><li>Save open files to the user’s OneDrive automatically while offline</li></ul>Apps that use the **documentsLibrary** special capability for these two purposes may also optionally use the capability to open embedded content within another document. Only the above uses of the **documentsLibrary** special capability are accepted.<ul><li>Your app can't access the Documents library in the phone's internal storage. If another app creates a Documents folder on the optional SD card, however, your app can see that folder.</li></ul>The **documentsLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<div class="code"><span codelanguage="XML"></span><table><colgroup><col width="100%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left">XML</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="left"><pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;&lt;uap:Capability Name="documentsLibrary"/&gt;&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br />Anyone may request access to this capability for store submission.
| **Game DVR Settings** | The **appCaptureSettings** restricted capability allows apps to control the user settings for the Game DVR.<br /><br />This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Media.Capture**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR226738) namespace. <br /><br />No one may request access to this capability for store submission.
| **Cellular** | The **cellularDeviceControl** restricted capability allows apps to have control over the cellular device.<br /><br />The **cellularDeviceIdentity** capability allows apps to access cellular identification data.<br /><br />The **cellularMessaging** capability allows apps to make use of SMS and RCS.<br /><br />These capabilities are required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Sms**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR206567) namespaces.<br /><br />Anyone may request access to these capabilities for store submission.
