# App capability declarations

Capabilities must be declared in your Windows app's [package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/appx-package-manifest) to access certain Windows 10 APIs or resources, such as pictures, music, or devices such as the camera or the microphone. Capabilities are used by UWP apps as well as other types of desktop apps that are packaged in an MSIX or AppX package for Windows 10.

You request access to specific resources or API by declaring capabilities in your app's [package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/appx-package-manifest). You can declare general capabilities by using the [Manifest Designer](/windows/msix/package/packaging-uwp-apps#configure-an-app-package) in Visual Studio, or you can add them manually. For more information, see [How to specify capabilities in a package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/how-to-specify-capabilities-in-a-package-manifest). It is important to know that when customers get your app from the Store, they're notified of all the capabilities that the app declares. Avoid declaring capabilities that your app doesn't need.

Some capabilities provide apps with access to a *sensitive resource*. These resources are considered sensitive because they can access the user's personal data or cost the user money. Privacy settings, managed by the Settings app, let the user dynamically control access to sensitive resources. Thus, it's important that your app doesn't assume a sensitive resource is always available. For more info about accessing sensitive resources, see [Guidelines for privacy-aware apps](../security/index.md). Capabilities that provide apps with access to a *sensitive resource* are annotated by an asterisk (\*) next to the capability scenario.

There are several types of capabilities.

- [General-use capabilities](#general-use-capabilities), which apply to most common app scenarios.
- [Device capabilities](#device-capabilities), which allow your app to access peripheral and internal devices.
- [Restricted capabilities](#restricted-capabilities), which require approval for Microsoft Store submission and/or are generally only available to Microsoft and certain partners.
- [Custom capabilities](#custom-capabilities).

## General-use capabilities

General-use capabilities are specified by using **Capability** elements in your app package manifest. These capabilities apply to the most common app scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> All **Capability** elements must come before any [CustomCapability](#custom-capabilities) and [DeviceCapability](#device-capabilities) elements under the **Capabilities** node in the package manifest.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Music**\* | The **musicLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Music library, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in jukebox apps that make use of the entire Music library.<br /><br />The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **musicLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the **file picker**.<br /><br /> The **musicLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below. <br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="musicLibrary"/></Capabilities>```
| **Pictures**\* | The **picturesLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Pictures library, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in photo apps that make use of the entire Pictures library.<br /><br />The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **picturesLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized them by using the **file picker**.<br /><br />The **picturesLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="picturesLibrary"/></Capabilities>```
| **Videos**\* | The **videosLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Videos, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in movie-playback apps that make use of the entire Videos library.<br /><br />The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **videosLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the **file picker**.<br /><br />The **videosLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="videosLibrary"/></Capabilities>```
| **Removable Storage** | The **removableStorage** capability provides programmatic access to files on removable storage, like USB keys and external hard drives, filtered to the file-type associations declared in the package manifest. For example, if a document-reader app declares a .doc file-type association, it can open .doc files on the removable storage device, but not other types of files. Be careful when you declare this capability, because users may include a variety of info in their removable storage devices, and will expect your app to provide a valid justification for programmatic access to the removable storage for all files of the declared type.<br /><br />Users will expect your app to handle any file associations that you declare. So don't declare file associations that your app cannot handle responsibly. The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app.<br /><br />Declare the **removableStorage** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker).<br /><br />The **removableStorage** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="removableStorage"/></Capabilities>```
| **Internet and public networks**\* | There are two capabilities that provide different levels of access to the Internet and public networks.<br /><br />The **internetClient** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Cannot act as a server. No local network access.<br />The **internetClientServer** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Can act as a server. No local network access.<br /><br />Most apps that have a web service component will use **internetClient**. Apps that enable peer-to-peer (P2P) scenarios where the app needs to listen for incoming network connections should use **internetClientServer**. The **internetClientServer** capability includes the access that the **internetClient** capability provides, so you don't need to specify **internetClient** when you specify **internetClientServer**.
| **Homes and work networks**\* | The **privateNetworkClientServer** capability provides inbound and outbound access to home and work networks through the firewall. This capability is typically used for games that communicate across the local area network (LAN), and for apps that share data across a variety of local devices. If your app specifies **musicLibrary**, **picturesLibrary**, or **videosLibrary**, you don't need to use this capability to access the corresponding library in a Home Group. On Windows, this capability does not provide access to the Internet.
| **Appointments** | The **appointments** capability provides access to the user's appointment store. This capability allows read access to appointments obtained from the synced network accounts and to other apps that write to the appointment store. With this capability, your app can create new calendars and write appointments to calendars that it creates.<br /><br />The **appointments** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="appointments"/></Capabilities>```
| **Contacts**\* | The **contacts** capability provides access to the aggregated view of the contacts from various contacts stores. This capability gives the app limited access (network permitting rules apply) to contacts that were synced from various networks and the local contact store.<br /><br />The **contacts** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="contacts"/></Capabilities>```
| **Code generation** | The **codeGeneration** capability allows apps to access the following functions which provide JIT capabilities to apps.<br /><br />[**VirtualProtectFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotectfromapp)<br />[**CreateFileMappingFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-createfilemappingfromapp)<br />[**OpenFileMappingFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-openfilemappingfromapp)<br />[**MapViewOfFileFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-mapviewoffilefromapp)
| **AllJoyn** | The **allJoyn** capability allows AllJoyn-enabled apps and devices on a network to discover and interact with each other.<br /><br />All apps that access APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.AllJoyn**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.AllJoyn) namespace must use this capability.
| **Phone calls** | The **phoneCall** capability allows apps to access all of the phone lines on the device and perform the following functions.<ul><li>Place a call on the phone line and show the system dialer without prompting the user.</li><li>Access line-related metadata.</li><li>Access line-related triggers.</li><li>Allows the user-selected spam filter app to set and check block list and call origin information.</li></ul>The **phoneCall** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="phoneCall"/></Capabilities>```<br /><br />The <b>phoneCallHistoryPublic</b> capability allows apps to read cellular and some VoIP call history information on the device. This capability also allows the app to write VoIP call history entries. This capability is required to access all members of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.PhoneCallHistoryStore"><b>PhoneCallHistoryStore</b></a> class.
| **Recorded Calls Folder**\* | The **recordedCallsFolder** device capability allows apps to access the recorded calls folder.<br /><br />The **recordedCallsFolder** capability must include the **mobile** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><mobile:Capability Name="recordedCallsFolder"/></Capabilities>```
| **User Account Information**\* | The **userAccountInformation** capability gives apps the ability to access the user's name and picture.<br /><br />This capability is required to access some APIs in the [**Windows.System.UserProfile**](/uwp/api/Windows.System.UserProfile) namespace.<br /><br />The **userAccountInformation** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="userAccountInformation"/></Capabilities>```
| **VoIP calling** | The **voipCall** capability allows apps to access the VoIP calling APIs in the [**Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls**](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls) namespace.<br /><br />The **voipCall** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="voipCall"/></Capabilities>```
| **3D Objects** | The **objects3D** capability allows apps to have programmatic access to the 3D object files. This capability is typically used in 3D apps and games that need access to the entire 3D objects library.<br /><br />This capability is required to access the folder that contains the 3D objects using APIs in the [**Windows.Storage**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage) namespace.<br /><br />The **objects3D** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="objects3D"/></Capabilities>```
| **Read Blocked Messages**\* | The **blockedChatMessages** capability allows apps to read SMS and MMS messages that have been blocked by the Spam Filter app.<br /><br />This capability is required to access the blocked messages using APIs in the [**Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat**](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat) namespace.<br /><br />The **blockedChatMessages** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="blockedChatMessages"/></Capabilities>```
| **Custom Devices** | The **lowLevelDevices** capability allows apps to access custom devices when a number of additional requirements are met. This capability should not be confused with the **lowLevel** device capability, which allows access to GPIO, I2C, SPI, and PWM devices.<br /><br /> If you develop a custom driver that exposes a [device interface](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/device-interface-classes) and you wish to open a handle to this device and send IOCTLs, you must: <ul><li>Enable the **lowLevelDevices** capability in your application manifest: ```<Capabilities><iot:Capability Name="lowLevelDevices"/></Capabilities>```</li><li>Enable [embedded mode](/windows/iot-core/develop-your-app/EmbeddedMode)</li><li>Mark the device interface as [restricted](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/devpkey-deviceinterface-restricted), either in your [INF](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/deviceaccess/register-the-device-interface-class-as-privileged) or by calling [WdfDeviceAssignInterfaceProperty()](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceassigninterfaceproperty)  in your driver.</ul>You can then use [**Windows.Devices.Custom.CustomDevice**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Custom.CustomDevice) to open a handle to your device. For more information, see [UWP device apps for internal devices](/windows-hardware/drivers/devapps/uwp-device-apps-for-specialized-devices).
| **IoT System Administration** | The **systemManagement** capability allows apps to have basic system administration privileges such as shutting down or rebooting, locale, and timezone.<br /><br />This capability is required to access some of the APIs in the [**Windows.System**](/uwp/api/Windows.System) namespace.<br /><br />The **systemManagement** capability must include the **iot** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><iot:Capability Name="systemManagement"/></Capabilities>```
| **Background Media Playback** | The **backgroundMediaPlayback** capability changes the behavior of the media-specific APIs like the [**MediaPlayer**](/uwp/api/windows.media.playback.mediaplayer) and [**AudioGraph**](/uwp/api/windows.media.audio.audiograph) classes to enable media playback while your app is in the background. All active audio streams will no longer mute, but will continue to be audible when an app transitions to the background. Additionally, app lifetime will be extended automatically while playback is occurring.
| **Remote System** | The **remoteSystem** capability allows apps to have access to a list of devices associated with the user's Microsoft Account. Access to the device list is necessary to perform any operations that persist across devices. This capability is required to access to all members of the following.<ul><li>[Windows.System.RemoteSystems](/uwp/api/windows.system.remotesystems) namespace</li><li>[Windows.System.RemoteLauncher](/uwp/api/Windows.System.RemoteLauncher) class</li><li>[AppServiceConnection.OpenRemoteAsync](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.appservice.appserviceconnection.openremoteasync) method</li></ul> |
| **Spatial Perception** | The **spatialPerception** capability provides programmatic access to spatial mapping data, giving mixed reality apps information about surfaces in application-specified regions of space near the user.  Declare the spatialPerception capability only when your app will explicitly use these surface meshes, as the capability is not required for mixed reality apps to perform holographic rendering based on the user's head pose. |
| **Global Media Control** | The **globalMediaControl** capability allows apps to access to playback sessions throughout the system that have integrated with [**SystemMediaTransportControls**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.SystemMediaTransportControls) to provide playback info and allow remote control. This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Media.Control**](/uwp/api/windows.media.control) namespace. This capability is defined in the [uap7:Capability](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-uap7-capability) element.  |

## Device capabilities

Device capabilities allow your app to access peripheral and internal devices. Device capabilities are specified by using **DeviceCapability** elements in your app package manifest. This element may require additional child elements and some device capabilities need to be added to the package manifest manually. For more info, see [How to specify device capabilities in a package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/how-to-specify-device-capabilities-in-a-package-manifest) and [**DeviceCapability Schema reference**](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-devicecapability).

> [!NOTE]
> You can have multiple **DeviceCapability** elements under the **Capabilities** element in the package manifest. All **DeviceCapability** elements must come after any **Capability** and [CustomCapability](#custom-capabilities) elements.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Location**\* | The **location** capability provides access to location functionality that is retrieved from dedicated hardware like a GPS sensor in the PC or is derived from available network info. Apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled location services from the **Settings** charm. |
| **Microphone** | The **microphone** capability provides access to the microphone's audio feed, which allows the app to record audio from connected microphones. Apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled the microphone from the **Settings** charm. |
| **Proximity** | The **proximity** capability enables multiple devices in close proximity to communicate with one another. This capability is typically used in casual multi-player games and in apps that exchange information. Devices attempt to use the communication technology that provides the best possible connection, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and the Internet. This capability is used only to initiate communication between the devices. |
| **Webcam** | The **webcam** capability provides access to the video feed of a built-in camera or external webcam, which allows the app to capture photos and videos. On Windows, apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled the camera from the **Settings** charm.<br/>The **webcam** capability only grants access to the video stream. In order to grant access to the audio stream as well, the **microphone** capability must be added. |
| **USB** | The **usb** device capability enables access to APIs in the [Updating the app manifest package for a USB device](/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/). |
| **Human interface device (HID)** | The **humaninterfacedevice** device capability enables access to APIs in the [How to specify device capabilities for HID](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/how-to-specify-device-capabilities-for-hid). |
| **Point of Service (POS)** | The **pointOfService** device capability enables access to APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.PointOfService**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.PointOfService) namespace. This namespace lets your app access Point of Service (POS) barcode scanners and magnetic stripe readers. The namespace provides a vendor-neutral interface for accessing POS devices from various manufacturers from a UWP app. |
| **Bluetooth** | The **bluetooth** device capability allows apps to communicate with already paired bluetooth devices over both Generic Attribute (GATT) or Classic Basic Rate (RFCOMM) protocol.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Bluetooth) namespace. |
| **Wi-Fi Networking** | The **wiFiControl** device capability allows apps to scan and connect to Wi-Fi networks.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.WiFi**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.WiFi) namespace. |
| **Radio state** | The **radios** device capability allows apps to toggle the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios.<br/>This capability is required to use the APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Radios**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Radios) namespace.  |
| **Optical disc** | The **optical** device capability allows apps to access functions on optical disk drives such as CD, DVD, and Blu-ray.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Custom**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Custom) namespace. |
| **Motion activity** | The **activity** device capability allows apps to detect the current motion of the device.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Sensors**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Sensors) namespace. |
| **Serial communication** | The **serialcommunication** device capability provides access to APIs in the Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication namespace, which allows a Windows app to communicate with a device that exposes a serial port or some abstraction of a serial port. This capability is required to use the APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.SerialCommnication**](/uwp/api/windows.devices.serialcommunication) namespace. |
| **Eye Tracker** | The **gazeInput** capability allows apps to detect where the user is looking within the application bounds when a compatible eye tracking device is connected. This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Input.Preview**](/uwp/api/windows.devices.input.preview) namespace. |
| **GPIO, I2C, SPI, and PWM** | The **lowLevel** device capability provides access to GPIO, I2C, SPI, and PWM devices. This capability is required to use the APIs in the following namespaces: [**Windows.Devices.Gpio**](/uwp/api/windows.devices.gpio), [**Windows.Devices.I2c**](/uwp/api/windows.devices.i2c), [**Windows.Devices.Spi**](/uwp/api/windows.devices.spi),[**Windows.Devices.Pwm**](/uwp/api/windows.devices.pwm).<br /><br />```<Capabilities><DeviceCapability Name="lowLevel"/></Capabilities>``` |


<span id="special-and-restricted-capabilities" />

## Restricted capabilities

If your app declares any restricted capabilities, you must provide info during the [app submission process](../publish/app-submissions.md) in order to be approved to publish the app to the Microsoft Store. You provide this info on the [Submission options](../publish/manage-submission-options.md#restricted-capabilities) page of your submission, explaining how your app uses each restricted capability that it declares.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restricted capabilities are intended for very specific scenarios. The use of these capabilities is highly restricted and subject to additional Store onboarding policy and review. Note that you can sideload apps that declare restricted capabilities without needing to receive any approval. Approval is only required when submitting these apps to the Store.

Be sure not to declare these restricted capabilities unless your app truly needs them. There are cases where such capabilities are necessary and appropriate, such as banking with two-factor authentication, where users provide a smart card with a digital certificate that confirms their identity. Other apps may be designed primarily for enterprise customers and may need access to corporate resources that cannot be accessed without the user's domain credentials.

To declare a restricted capability, modify your [app package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/appx-package-manifest) source file (`Package.appxmanifest`). Add the **xmlns:rescap** XML namespace declaration, and use the **rescap** prefix when you declare your restricted capability. For example, here's how to declare the **appCaptureSettings** capability.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Package
    ...
    xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities"
    IgnorableNamespaces="... rescap">
...
<Capabilities>
    <rescap:Capability Name="appCaptureSettings"/>
</Capabilities>
</Package>
```

> [!NOTE]
> All restricted capability elements must come before any [CustomCapability](#custom-capabilities) and [DeviceCapability](#device-capabilities) elements under the **Capabilities** node in the package manifest.

### Restricted capability approval process

Previously, we required you to contact support to get approval to use a capability. We now allow you to provide this info in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) as part of the [submission process](../publish/app-submissions.md).

When you upload packages for your submission, we will detect whether any restricted capabilities are declared. If we do so, you will be required to provide details about how your product uses each capability on the [Submission options](../publish/manage-submission-options.md#restricted-capabilities) page. Be sure to provide as much detail as possible to help us understand why your product needs to declare the capability. Note that this may add some additional time for your submission to complete the certification process.

During the certification process, our testers will review the info you provide to determine whether your submission is approved to use the capability. Note that this may add some additional time for your submission to complete the certification process. If we approve your use of the capability, your app will continue through the rest of the certification process. You generally will not have to repeat the capability approval process when you submit updates to your app (unless you declare additional capabilities).

If we don't approve your use of the capability, your submission will fail certification, and we will provide feedback in the certification report. You then have the option to create a new submission and upload packages which don't declare the capability, or, if applicable, address any issues related to your use of the capability and request approval in a new submission.

> [!NOTE]
> If your submission uses a development sandbox in Partner Center (for example, this is the case for any game that integrates with Xbox Live), you must request approval in advance rather than providing info on the **Submission options** page. To do so, visit the [Windows Developer support page](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/support). Select Developer support topic **Dashboard issue**, Issue Type **App submissions**, and Subcategory **Other**. Then describe how you are using the capability and why it is necessary for your product. If you do not provide all the information necessary, your request will be denied. You may also be asked to provide more information. Note that this process typically takes 5 business days or longer, so please submit your request well in advance.
>
> You may also use this method of requesting approval (rather than providing this info during your submission), whether or not you're using a development sandbox, if you prefer to confirm that you are approved to use a restricted capability before you start your submission.

<span id="restricted-and-special-use-capability-list" />

### Restricted capability list

The following table lists the restricted capabilities. You may request approval for these capabilities in apps that you submit to the Store by following the process described above.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of these restricted capabilities are almost never approved for apps submitted to the Store, except in very specific and limited circumstances. These capabilities are called out in the table below. We recommend not declaring these capabilities in your app if you plan to distribute it through the Store.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Enterprise** | Windows domain credentials enable a user to log into remote resources using their credentials, and act as if a user provided their user name and password. The **enterpriseAuthentication** capability is typically used in line-of-business apps that connect to servers within an enterprise. <br /><br />You don't need this capability for generic communication across the Internet.<br /><br />The **enterpriseAuthentication** capability is intended to support common line-of-business apps. Don't declare it in apps that don't need to access corporate resources. The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that enables users to open files on a network share for use with an app. Declare the **enterpriseAuthentication** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access, and you cannot realize them by using the **file picker**.<br /><br />The **enterpriseAuthentication** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="enterpriseAuthentication"/></Capabilities>```<br /><br />The **enterpriseDataPolicy** capability allows apps to handle enterprise data separately and safely when the app is managed with Windows Information Protection policy (For example: Mobile Device Management and Mobile Application Management systems).  Declare this restricted capability as shown below. <br /><br />```<Capabilities><rescap:Capability Name="enterpriseDataPolicy"/></Capabilities>```<br /><br />This capability is required to use all members of the following classes.<ul><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Security.EnterpriseData.FileProtectionManager">FileProtectionManager</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Security.EnterpriseData.DataProtectionManager">DataProtectionManager</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Security.EnterpriseData.ProtectionPolicyManager">ProtectionPolicyManager</a></li></ul> |
| **Shared user certificates** | The **sharedUserCertificates** capability enables an app to add and access software and hardware-based certificates in the Shared User store, such as certificates stored on a smart card. This capability is typically used for financial or enterprise apps that require a smart card for authentication.<br /><br />The **sharedUserCertificates** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="sharedUserCertificates"/></Capabilities>``` |
|**Documents**\* | The **documentsLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Documents library, filtered to the file type associations declared in the package manifest. For example, if a word processing app declared a .doc file type association, it can open .doc files in the user's Documents library. <br /><br />The **documentsLibrary** capability is *only* needed if your application programmatically accesses the Documents library *without* user intervention. Your application <b>does not</b> need the **documentsLibrary** capability to access the Documents library if the user chooses it with a picker API. Generally, apps should allow the user to choose the location of their files, using one of the following picker APIs: <ul><li>[FileOpenPicker](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) to open an existing file.</li><li>[FileSavePicker](/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.filesavepicker) to save a new file.</li><li>[FolderPicker](/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.folderpicker) to choose a folder to open / save additional files from.</li></ul>Using these APIs allows the user to choose a location that works best for them, such as a cloud-synced account (eg, OneDrive). After the user has picked a file or folder using these APIs, your app can get ongoing access to the location by using the [FutureAccessList](/uwp/api/windows.storage.accesscache.storageapplicationpermissions.futureaccesslist) API. This API allows your app to access the files or folders in the future without asking the user to pick them again.<br /><br />In cases where existing workflows assume files will be in the Documents library (for example, interop with an existing desktop application) or where you do not want the user to have to choose the location, you can declare the **documentsLibrary** capability for your application. If you use the **documentsLibrary** capability for your application, it is recommended that you also allow the user to pick locations manually.<br /><br />The **documentsLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br /><br />```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="documentsLibrary"/></Capabilities>``` |
| **Game DVR Settings** | The **appCaptureSettings** restricted capability allows apps to control the user settings for the Game DVR.<br /><br />This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Media.Capture**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture) namespace. <br /><br />We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store.

Local System services require both the **packagedServices** and **localSystemServices** capabilities.<br /><br />We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved.  |
| **Local System Services** | The **localSystemServices** restricted capability allows applications that are created by Microsoft partners and enterprises to install one or more Local System services along with the app (that is, your application can declare the StartAccount for the services to be LocalSystem). This scenario also requires the **packagesServices** capability. <br /><br />We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved. |
| **Background Spatial Perception** | The **backgroundSpatialPerception** restricted capability allows an application to access the movement of the user's head, hands, motion controllers, and other tracked objects while the app is running in the background. |

## Custom capabilities

The [restricted capabilities](#restricted-capabilities) section above describes the same capability approval process that you can use to request approval to use a custom capability. The [embedded SIM](/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.esim) APIs are examples of APIs that require a custom capability. If you only want to run your application locally in developer mode, then you don't need the custom capability. But you need it to publish your app to the Microsoft Store, or to run it outside of developer mode.

If you have a Windows Technical Account Manager (TAM), then you can work with your TAM to request access. You can find more details at [Contact your Microsoft TAM](/windows-hardware/drivers/mobilebroadband/testing-your-desktop-cosa-apn-database-submission#contact-your-microsoft-tam).

To declare a custom capability, modify your [app package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/appx-package-manifest) source file (`Package.appxmanifest`). Add the **xmlns:uap4** XML namespace declaration, and use the **uap4** prefix when you declare your custom capability. Here's an example.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Package
    ...
    xmlns:uap4="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/4">
...
<Capabilities>
    <uap4:CustomCapability Name="CompanyName.customCapabilityName_PublisherID"/>
</Capabilities>
</Package>
```

> [!NOTE]
> All **CustomCapability** elements must come after any **Capability** elements and before any [DeviceCapability](#device-capabilities) elements under the **Capabilities** node in the package manifest.
