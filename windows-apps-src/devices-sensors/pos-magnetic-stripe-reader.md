# Magnetic stripe reader

A magnetic stripe reader can scan certain types of cards that have a magnetic stripe on them, such as credit cards, driver's licenses, and store loyalty cards. You have likely encountered one when buying something in a store.

Using a magnetic stripe reader in your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application is similar to using any other point of service device, in that you have to enumerate the available devices, create the device object, and claim the device before you can use it. Follow the documentation under [Getting started with Point of Service](pos-basics.md) for more information.

The topics below provide further information on using a magnetic stripe reader in your application.
