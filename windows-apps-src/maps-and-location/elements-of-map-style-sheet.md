# Map style sheet reference

Microsoft mapping technologies use _map style sheets_ to define the appearance of maps.  A map style sheet is defined using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and can be used in various ways including in a Windows Store application's [MapControl](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps.mapcontrol) through the [MapStyleSheet.ParseFromJson](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps.mapstylesheet.parsefromjson#Windows_UI_Xaml_Controls_Maps_MapStyleSheet_ParseFromJson_System_String_) method.

Style sheets can be created interactively using the [Map Style Sheet Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/p/map-style-sheet-editor/9nbhtcjt72ft) application.

The following JSON can be used to make water areas appear in red, water labels appear in green, and land areas appear in blue:

```json
    {"version":"1.*",
        "settings":{"landColor":"#0000FF"},
        "elements":{"water":{"fillColor":"#FF0000","labelColor":"#00FF00"}}
    }
```

This JSON can be used to remove all labels and points from a map.

```json

    {"version":"1.*", "elements":{"mapElement":{"labelVisible":false},"point":{"visible":false}}}
```

Sometimes the value of a property is transformed to produce the final result.  For example, vegetation fillColor has slightly different shades depending on type of the entity being displayed.  This behavior can be turned off, thereby using the precise provided value, by using the ignoreTransform property.

```json
    {"version":"1.*",
        "settings":{"shadedReliefVisible":false},
        "elements":{"vegetation":{"fillColor":{"value":"#999999","ignoreTransform":true}}}
    }
```

This topic shows the JSON entries and [properties](#properties) that you can use to customize the look and feel of your maps.  These properties can also be applied to user map elements through the [MapStyleSheetEntry](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps.mapelement.mapstylesheetentry) property.
