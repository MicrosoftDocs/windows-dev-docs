# Maps and location overview




This section explains how you can display maps, use map services, find the location, and set up a geofence in your app. This section also shows you how to launch the Windows Maps app to a specific map, route, or a set of turn-by-turn directions.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about using maps and location in your app, download the following samples from the [Windows-universal-samples repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples) on GitHub:
-   [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) map sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/MapControl)
-   [UWP geolocation sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Geolocation)

 

## Display maps


Display maps with 2D, 3D, or Streetside views in your app by using APIs from the [**Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps) namespace. You can mark points of interest (POI) on the map by using pushpins, images, shapes, or XAML UI elements. You can also overlay tiled images or replace the map images altogether.

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Request a maps authentication key](authentication-key.md) | Your app must be authenticated before it can use the [**MapControl**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps.MapControl) and map services in the [**Windows.Services.Maps**](/uwp/api/Windows.Services.Maps) namespace. To authenticate your app, you must specify a maps authentication key. This article describes how to request a maps authentication key from the [Bing Maps Developer Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) and add it to your app. |
| [Display maps with 2D, 3D, and Streetside views](display-maps.md) | Display customizable maps in your app by using the [**MapControl**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps.MapControl) class. This topic also introduces aerial 3D and Streetside views. |
| [Display points of interest (POI) on a map](display-poi.md) | Add points of interest (POI) to a map by using pushpins, images, shapes, and XAML UI elements. |
| [Overlay tiled images on a map](overlay-tiled-images.md) | Overlay third-party or custom tiled images on a map by using tile sources. Use tile sources to overlay specialized information such as weather data, population data, or seismic data; or use tile sources to replace the default map entirely. |



## Access map services

Add routes, directions, and geocoding capabilities to your app by using APIs from the [**Windows.Services.Maps**](/uwp/api/Windows.Services.Maps) namespace.

| [Display routes and directions](routes-and-directions.md) | Request routes and directions, and display them in your app. |
| [Perform geocoding and reverse geocoding](geocoding.md) | Convert addresses to geographic locations (geocoding) and convert geographic locations to addresses (reverse geocoding) by calling the methods of the [**MapLocationFinder**](/uwp/api/Windows.Services.Maps.MapLocationFinder) class in the [**Windows.Services.Maps**](/uwp/api/Windows.Services.Maps) namespace. |
| [Find and download map packages for offline use](/uwp/api/windows.services.maps.offlinemaps)| In the past, your app had to direct users to the Settings app to download offline Maps. Now, you can use classes in the [Windows.Services.Maps.OfflineMaps](/uwp/api/windows.services.maps.offlinemaps) namespace to find downloaded packages in a given area (based on a [Geopoint](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geopoint), [GeoboundingBox](/uwp/api/windows.devices.geolocation.geoboundingbox), etc.). <br> You can also check and listen for the downloaded status of map packages as well as start a download without requiring the user to leave your app. <br> You'll find examples of how to do this in both the reference content and the [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) map sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/MapControl).

## Get the user's location

Get the user's current location and be notified when the location changes in your app by using APIs from the [**Windows.Devices.Geolocation**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Geolocation) namespace. These API members are also frequently used in parameters of the maps APIs. APIs from the [**Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geofencing**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geofencing) namespace notify your app when the user enters or exits a geofence (a predefined geographical area).

## Launch the Windows Maps app

Your app can launch the Windows Maps app as shown here to display specific maps and turn-by-turn directions. Rather than provide map functionality directly in your own app, consider using the Windows Maps app to provide that functionality. For more info, see [Launch the Windows Maps app](../launch-resume/launch-maps-app.md).
