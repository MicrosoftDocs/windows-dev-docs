# Request a maps authentication key

> [!WARNING]
> Online maps services may not be available on older versions of Windows 10. On the following versions, 
MapControl may no longer display maps and APIs in the Windows.Services.Maps namespace may not return results:
> - Windows 10, version 1607 and earlier versions: map services will be unavailable worldwide starting in October 2020
> - Windows 10, version 1703 and earlier versions: map services are unavailable on [some devices sold in China](/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-mapcontrol-desktop-chinavariantwin10)

Your [Universal Windows app](../get-started/universal-application-platform-guide.md) must be authenticated before it can use the [**MapControl**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps.MapControl) and map services in the [**Windows.Services.Maps**](/uwp/api/Windows.Services.Maps) namespace. To authenticate your app, you must specify a maps authentication key. This topic describes how to request a maps authentication key from the [Bing Maps Developer Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) and add it to your app.

**Tip** To learn more about using maps in your app, download the following sample from the [Windows-universal-samples repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples) on GitHub:

## Get a key


Create and manage map authentication keys for your Universal Windows apps using the [Bing Maps Developer Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/).

To create a new key

1.  In your browser, navigate to the Bing Maps Developer Center ([https://www.bingmapsportal.com](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/)).

2.  If you are asked to sign in, enter your Microsoft account and click **Sign in**.

3.  Choose the account to associate with your Bing Maps account. If you want to use your Microsoft account, click **Yes**. Otherwise, click **Sign in with another account**.

4.  If you don't already have a Bing Maps account, create a new Bing Maps account. Enter the **Account Name**, **Contact Name**, **Company Name**, **Email Address**, and **Phone Number**. After accepting the terms of use, click **Create**.

5.  Under the **My account** menu, click **My Keys**.

6.  If you have previously created a key, click on the link to create a new key. Otherwise proceed to the Create Key form.

7.  Complete the **Create Key** form and then click **Create**.

    -   **Application name:** The name of your application.
    -   **Application URL (optional):** The URL of your application.
    -   **Key type:** Select **Basic** or **Enterprise**.
    -   **Application type:** Select **Windows Application** for use in your Universal Windows app.

    This is an example of what the form looks like.

8.  After you click **Create**, the new key appears below the **Create Key** form. Copy it to a safe place or immediately add it to your app, as described in the next step.

## Add the key to your app


The map authentication key is required to use the [**MapControl**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps.MapControl) and map services ([**Windows.Services.Maps**](/uwp/api/Windows.Services.Maps)) in your Universal Windows app. Add it to the map control and map service objects, as applicable.

### To add the key to a map control

To authenticate the [**MapControl**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps.MapControl), set the [**MapServiceToken**](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps.mapcontrol.mapservicetoken) property to the authentication key value. You can set this property in code or in XAML markup, depending on your preferences. For more info about using the **MapControl**, see [Display maps with 2D, 3D, and Streetside views](display-maps.md).

-   This example sets the **MapServiceToken** to the value of the authentication key in code.

    ```cs
    MapControl1.MapServiceToken = "abcdef-abcdefghijklmno";
    ```

-   This example sets the **MapServiceToken** to the value of the authentication key in XAML markup.

    ```xml
    <Maps:MapControl x:Name="MapControl1" MapServiceToken="abcdef-abcdefghijklmno"/>
    ```

### To add the key to map services

To use services in the [**Windows.Services.Maps**](/uwp/api/Windows.Services.Maps) namespace, set the [**ServiceToken**](/uwp/api/windows.services.maps.mapservice.servicetoken) property to the authentication key value. For more info about using map services, see [Display routes and directions](routes-and-directions.md) and [Perform geocoding and reverse geocoding](geocoding.md).

-   This example sets the **ServiceToken** to the value of the authentication key in code.

    ```cs
    MapService.ServiceToken = "abcdef-abcdefghijklmno";
    ```
