# Voice and tone

From detailed instructions to simple tooltips, text is a necessary component of almost all apps. As such a fundamental part of the user experience, text should augment an app's design, fitting the purpose of the app and the visual presentation.

As in all writing, when creating the text for your app, you should be deliberate about your choice of voice and tone. These two are similar, but distinct — think of voice as your attitude towards the subject, while tone is its implementation. As the text in your app is written for the user, your voice should always be friendly and natural, something that can establish an immediate connection. Your tone can be more flexible, so long as it follows some general guidelines and works well with that voice and the needs of your app. By carefully choosing the right words and phrases, you can enhance the app's user experience, and make bad situations — such as encountering an error — easier and more pleasant for the user.

## Creating a friendly, natual voice

The voice of your app is a natural and intuitive extension of its purpose and design. Pick words that sound comfortable to you — they'll feel comfortable to the user, too.

One helpful strategy is to imagine that you're talking to a hypothetical user of your app. Someone you know already, maybe a friend or family member or business associate. How would you explain the app to them? How would you talk about its features, how would you give them instructions? You're used to changing your voice and tone to fit the subject matter when talking, so this can put you on the right track for writing.

For contrast, it could also be useful to imagine how you would describe a completely different app. If you're making a game, think of what you'd say or write to describe a financial or a news app. If you're designing something to boost productivity, imagine how you'd talk about an educational app. By exploring what language and structure you might use to talk about different topics, sometimes you can gain new insight into what you should be doing for the subject you're writing about.

For more ideas, take a look at similar apps for inspiration or search the web for more advice. Finding the right voice is a problem that many people struggle with, so don't feel bad if it's not easy to settle on something that feels quite right.

## General tone advice for UWP apps

Space in apps is limited, and it's important to use it well. No matter the specific tone your app requires, we recommend that you keep these principles in mind when writing its text:

#### Lead with what's important

Users need to be able to read and understand your text at a glance. Don't pad your words with unnecessary introductions. Give your key points the most visibility, and always present the core of an idea before you add onto it.

**Good:** Select "filters" to add effects to your image.

**Bad:** If you want to add visual effects or alterations to your image, select "filters."

#### Clarity is key

Use language that will be familiar to your audience. Usually this means choosing everyday and conversational words, but apps for specialized uses will have their own standards. Your users should never have to wonder what your text means, so favor simplicity if you're ever unsure of which tone to use.

**Good:** Select "settings" to change how the app saves your pictures.

**Bad:** The default behavior of the app can be configured in the "settings" menu.

#### Contractions aren't a problem

People are used to contractions, and expect to see them. Avoiding them can make your app seem too formal or even stilted.

**Good:** When you're happy with your image, press "save" to add it to your gallery. From there, you'll be able to share it with friends.

**Bad:** When you are happy with your image, press "save" to add it to your gallery. From there, you will be able to share it with friends.

#### Emphasize action

Apps are defined by actions. Users take action as they use the app, and the app takes action as it responds to the users. Make sure your text uses the *active voice* throughout your app. Users and functions should be described as doing things, instead of having things done to them.

**Good:** Restart the app to see your changes.

**Bad:** The changes will be applied when the app is restarted.

#### Short and sweet

Users scan text, and will often skip over larger blocks of words entirely. Don't sacrifice necessary information and presentation, but don't use more words than you have to. Sometimes, this will mean relying on many shorter sentences or fragments. Other times, this will mean being extra choosy about the words and structure of longer sentences.

**Good:** Sorry, we couldn't upload the picture. If this happens again, try restarting the app. But don't worry — your picture will be waiting when you come back.

**Bad:** An error occured, and we weren't able to upload the picture. Please try again, and if you encounter this problem again, you may need to restart the app. But don't worry - we've saved your work locally, and it'll be waiting for you when you come back.
