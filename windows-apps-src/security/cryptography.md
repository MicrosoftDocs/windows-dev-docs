## Terminology


The following terminology is commonly used in cryptography and public key infrastructure (PKI).

| Term                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encryption                  | The process of transforming data by using a cryptographic algorithm and key. The transformed data can be recovered only by using the same algorithm and the same (symmetric) or related (public) key. |
| Decryption                  | The process of returning encrypted data to its original form.                                                                                                                                         |
| Plaintext                   | Originally referred to an unencrypted text message. Currently refers to any unencrypted data.                                                                                                         |
| Ciphertext                  | Originally referred to an encrypted, and therefore unreadable, text message. Currently refers to any encrypted data.                                                                                  |
| Hashing                     | The process of converting variable length data into a fixed length, typically smaller, value. By comparing hashes, you can obtain reasonable assurance that two or more data are the same.            |
| Signature                   | Encrypted hash of digital data typically used to authenticate the sender of the data or verify that the data was not tampered with during transmission.                                               |
| Algorithm                   | A step-by-step procedure for encrypting data.                                                                                                                                                         |

| Symmetric Key Cryptography  | Cryptography in which encryption and decryption use the same key. This is also known as secret key cryptography.                                                                                      |
| Asymmetric Key Cryptography | Cryptography in which encryption and decryption use a different but mathematically related key. This is also called public key cryptography.                                                          |
| Encoding                    | The process of encoding digital messages, including certificates, for transport across a network.                                                                                                     |
| Algorithm Provider          | A DLL that implements a cryptographic algorithm.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Key Storage Provider        | A container for storing key material. Currently, keys can be stored in software, smart cards, or the trusted platform module (TPM).                                                                   |
| X.509 Certificate           | A digital document, typically issued by a certification authority, to verify the identity of an individual, system, or entity to other interested parties.                                            |

| [Certificates](certificates.md)                                               | This article discusses the use of certificates in UWP apps. Digital certificates are used in public key cryptography to bind a public key to a person, computer, or organization. The bound identities are most often used to authenticate one entity to another. For example, certificates are often used to authenticate a web server to a user and a user to a web server. You can create certificate requests and install or import issued certificates. You can also enroll a certificate in a certificate hierarchy. |
