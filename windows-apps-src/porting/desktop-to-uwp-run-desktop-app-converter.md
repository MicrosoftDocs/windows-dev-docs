# Package an app using the Desktop App Converter (Desktop Bridge)

[Get the Desktop App Converter](https://aka.ms/converter)

You can use the Desktop App Converter (DAC) to bring your desktop apps to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). This includes Win32 apps and apps that you've created by using .NET 4.6.1.

<div style="float: left; padding: 10px">
    ![DAC Icon](images/desktop-to-uwp/dac.png)
</div>

While the term "Converter" appears in the name of this tool, it doesn't actually convert your app. Your app remains unchanged. However, this tool generates a Windows app package with a package identity and the ability to call a vast range of WinRT APIs.

You can install that package by using the Add-AppxPackage PowerShell cmdlet on your development machine.

The converter runs the desktop installer in an isolated Windows environment by using a clean base image provided as part of the converter download. It captures any registry and file system I/O made by the desktop installer and packages it as part of the output.

## The DAC does more than just generate a package for you

Here's a few extra things it can do for you.

**Windows 10 Creators Update**

<div style="float: left; ">
    ![Check](images/desktop-to-uwp/check.png)
</div>

Automatically register your preview handlers, thumbnail handlers, property handlers, firewall rules, URL flags.

<div style="float: left; ">
    ![Check](images/desktop-to-uwp/check.png)
</div>

Automatically register file type mappings that enable users to group files by using the **Kind** column in File Explorer.

<div style="float: left; ">
    ![Check](images/desktop-to-uwp/check.png)
</div>

Register your public COM servers.

**Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later**

<div style="float: left; ">
    ![Check](images/desktop-to-uwp/check.png)
</div>

Automatically sign your package so that you can test your app.

<div style="float: left; ">
    ![Check](images/desktop-to-uwp/check.png)
</div>

Validate your app against Desktop Bridge and Windows Store requirements.

To find a complete list of options, see the [Parameters](#command-reference) section of this guide.

If you're ready to create your package, let's start.

## First, consider how you'll distribute your app
If you plan to publish your app to the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps), start by filling out [this form](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/projects/campaigns/desktop-bridge). Microsoft will contact you to start the onboarding process. As part of this process, you'll reserve a name in the store, and obtain information that you'll need to package your app.

## Make sure that your system can run the converter

Make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

* Windows 10 Anniversary Update (10.0.14393.0 and later) Pro or Enterprise edition.
* 64 bit (x64) processor
* Hardware-assisted virtualization
* Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
* [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=821375).


## Start the Desktop App Converter

1. Download and install the [Desktop App Converter](https://aka.ms/converter).

2. Run the Desktop App Converter as an administrator.

    ![run DAC as administrator](images/desktop-to-uwp/run-converter.png)

   A console window appears. You'll use that console window to run commands.

## Set a few things up (apps with installers only)

You can skip ahead to the next section if your app doesn't have an installer.

1. Identify the version number of your operating system.

   You can do that by opening the **System Information app** on your computer and then finding the version number of your operating system.

    ![operating system version in the System Information app](images/desktop-to-uwp/os-version.png)

2. Download the appropriate [Desktop app Converter base image](https://aka.ms/converterimages).

   Make sure that the version number that appears in the name of the file matches the version number of your Windows build.

   ![matching base image version](images/desktop-to-uwp/base-image-version.png)

   Place the downloaded file anywhere on your computer where you'll be able to find it later.

3. In the console window that appeared when you started the Desktop App Converter, run this command: ```Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass```.
4.	Set up the converter by running  this command: ```DesktopAppConverter.exe -Setup -BaseImage .\BaseImage-1XXXX.wim -Verbose```.
5.	Restart your computer if you're prompted to do so.

    Status messages appear in the console window as the converter expands the base image. If you don't see any status messages, press any key. This can cause the contents of the console window to refresh.

    ![status messages in the console window](images/desktop-to-uwp/bas-image-setup.png)

    When the base image is fully expanded, move to the next section.

## Package an app

To Package your app, run the ``DesktopAppConverter.exe`` command in the console window that opened when you started the Desktop App Converter.  

You'll specify the package name, publisher and version number of the app by using parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've reserved your app name in the Windows store, you can obtain the package and publisher names by using the Windows Dev Center dashboard. If you plan to sideload your app onto other systems, you can provide your own names for these as long as the publisher name that you choose matches the name on the certificate you use to sign your app.

### A quick look at command parameters

Here are the required parameters.

```CMD
DesktopAppConverter.exe
-Installer <String>
-Destination <String>
-PackageName <String>
-Publisher <String>
-Version <Version>
```
You can read about each one [here](#command-reference).

### Examples

Here's a few common ways to package your app.

* [Package an app that has an installer (.msi) file](#installer-conversion)
* [Package an app that has a setup executable file](#setup-conversion)
* [Package an app that doesn't have an installer](#no-installer-conversion)
* [Package an app, sign the app, and prepare it for store submission](#optional-parameters)

<span id="installer-conversion" />
#### Package an app that has an installer (.msi) file

Point to the installer file by using the ``Installer`` parameter.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyAppSetup.msi -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that your installer is located in an independent folder and that only files related to that installer are in the same folder. The converter copies all of the contents of that folder to the isolated Windows environment.

<span id="setup-conversion" />
#### Package an app that has a setup executable file

Point to the setup executable by using the ``Installer`` parameter.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyAppSetup.exe -InstallerArguments "/S" -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1
```

The ``InstallerArguments`` parameter is an optional parameter. However, because the Desktop App Converter needs your installer to run in unattended mode, you might have to use it if your app needs silent flags to run silently. The ``/S`` flag is a very common silent flag, but the flag that you use might be different depending on which installer technology you used to create the setup file.

<span id="no-installer-conversion" />
#### Package an app that doesn't have an installer

In this example, use the ``Installer`` parameter to point to the root folder of your app files.

Use the `AppExecutable` parameter to point to your apps executable file.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyApp\ -AppExecutable MyApp.exe -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1
```

<iframe src="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses-embed/developers-guide-to-the-desktop-bridge-17373/Demo-Convert-a-No-Installer-Application-agAXF2WhD_3506218965" width="636" height="480" allowFullScreen frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<span id="optional-parameters" />
#### Package an app, sign the app, and run validation checks on the package

This example is similar to first one except it shows how you can sign your app for local testing, and then validate your app against Desktop Bridge and Windows Store requirements.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyAppSetup.exe -InstallerArguments "/S" -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1 -MakeAppx -Sign -Verbose -Verify
```

The ``Sign`` parameter generates a certificate and then signs your app with it. To run your app, you'll have to install that generated certificate. To learn how, see the [Run the packaged app](#run-app) section of this guide.

You can validate you app by using the ``Verify`` parameter.

### A quick look at optional parameters

The ``Sign`` and ``Verify`` parameters are optional. There are many more optional parameters.  Here are some of the more commonly used optional parameters.

```CMD
[-ExpandedBaseImage <String>]
[-AppExecutable <String>]
[-AppFileTypes <String>]
[-AppId <String>]
[-AppDisplayName <String>]
[-AppDescription <String>]
[-PackageDisplayName <String>]
[-PackagePublisherDisplayName <String>]
[-MakeAppx]
[-LogFile <String>]
[<CommonParameters>]
```
You can read about all of them in the next section.

<span id="run-app" />
## Run the packaged app

There's two ways to run your app.

One way is to open a PowerShell command prompt, and then type this command: ```Add-AppxPackage –Register AppxManifest.xml```. It's probably the easiest way to run your app because you don't have to sign it.

Another way is to sign your app with a certificate. If you use the ```sign``` parameter, the Desktop App Converter will generate one for you, and then sign your app with it. That file is named **auto-generated.cer**, and you can find it in the root folder of your packaged app.

Follow these steps to install the generated certificate, and then run your app.

1. Double-click the **auto-generated.cer** file to install the certificate.

   ![generated certificate file](images/desktop-to-uwp/generated-cert-file.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're prompted for a password, use the default password "123456".

2. In the **Certificate** dialog box, choose the **Install Certificate** button.
3. In the **Certificate Import Wizard**, install the certificate onto the **Local Machine**, and place the certificate into the **Trusted People** certificate store.

   ![Trusted People Store](images/desktop-to-uwp/trusted-people-store.png)

5. In root folder of your packaged app, double click the Windows app package file.

   ![Windows app package file](images/desktop-to-uwp/windows-app-package.png)

6. Install the app, by choosing the **Install** button.

   ![Install button](images/desktop-to-uwp/install.png)


## Modify the packaged app

You'll likely make changes to your packaged app to address bugs, add visual assets, or enhance your app with modern experiences such as live tiles.

After you make your changes, you don't need to run the converter again. You can repackage your app by using the MakeAppx tool and the appxmanifest.xml file the DAC generates for your app. See [Generate a Windows app package](desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion.md#make-appx).

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes to registry settings that your installer makes, you will have to run the Desktop App Converter again to pick up those changes.

The following two sections describe a couple of optional fix-ups to the packaged app that you might consider.

### Delete unnecessary files and registry keys

The desktop App Converter takes a very conservative approach to filtering out files and system noise in the container.

If you want, you can review the VFS folder and delete any files that your installer doesn't need.  You can also review the contents of Reg.dat and delete any keys that are not installed/needed by the app.

### Fix corrupted PE headers

During the conversion process, the DesktopAppConverter automatically runs the PEHeaderCertFixTool to fixup any corrupted PE headers. However, you can also run the PEHeaderCertFixTool on a UWP Windows app package, loose files, or a specific binary. Here's an example.

```CMD
PEHeaderCertFixTool.exe <binary file>|<.appx package>|&lt;folder> [/c] [/v]
 /c   -- check for corrupted certificate but do not fix (optional)
 /v   -- verbose (optional)
example1: PEHeaderCertFixTool app.exe
example2: PEHeaderCertFixTool c:\package.appx /c
example3: PEHeaderCertFixTool c:\myapp /c /v
```

## Known issues and disclosures

### Known issues and workarounds

Here's some known issues and some things you can try to resolve them.

#### E_CREATING_ISOLATED_ENV_FAILED an E_STARTING_ISOLATED_ENV_FAILED errors    

If you receive either of these errors, make sure that you're using a valid base image from the [download center](https://aka.ms/converterimages).
If you’re using a valid base image, try using ``-Cleanup All`` in your command.
If that does not work, please send us your logs at converter@microsoft.com to help us investigate.

#### New-ContainerNetwork: The object already exists error

You might receive this error when you setup a new base image. This can happen if you have a Windows Insider flight on a developer machine that previously had the Desktop App Converter installed.

To resolve this issue, try running the command `Netsh int ipv4 reset` from an elevated command prompt, and then reboot your machine.

#### Your .NET app is compiled with the "AnyCPU" build option and fails to install

This can happen if the main executable or any of the dependencies were placed anywhere in the **Program Files** or **Windows\System32** folder hierarchy.

To resolve this issue, try using your architecture-specific desktop installer (32 bit or 64 bit) to generate a Windows app package.

#### Publishing public side-by-side Fusion assemblies won't work

 During install, an application can publish public side-by-side Fusion assemblies, accessible to any other process. During process activation context creation, these assemblies are retrieved by a system process named CSRSS.exe. When this is done for a converted process, activation context creation and module loading of these assemblies will fail. The side-by-side Fusion assemblies are registered in the following locations:
  + Registry: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SideBySide\Winners`
  + File System: %windir%\\SideBySide

This is a known limitation and no workaround currently exists. That said, Inbox assemblies, like ComCtl, are shipped with the OS, so taking a dependency on them is safe.

#### Error found in XML. The 'Executable' attribute is invalid - The value 'MyApp.EXE' is invalid according to its datatype

This can happen if the executables in your application have a capitalized **.EXE** extension. Although, the casing of this extension shouldn't affect whether your app runs, this can cause the DAC to generate this error.

To resolve this issue, try specifying the **-AppExecutable** flag when you package, and use the lower case ".exe" as the extension of your main executable (For example: MYAPP.exe).    Alternately you can change the casing for all executables in your app from lowercase to uppercase (For example: from .EXE to .exe).


### Telemetry from Desktop App Converter

Desktop App Converter may collect information about you and your use of the software and send this info to Microsoft. You can learn more about Microsoft's data collection and use in the product documentation and in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

By default, telemetry will be enabled for the Desktop App Converter. Add the following registry key to configure telemetry to a desired setting:  

```cmd
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DesktopAppConverter
```
+ Add or edit the *DisableTelemetry* value by using a DWORD set to 1.
+ To enable telemetry, remove the key or set the value to 0.

### Language support

The Desktop App Converter does not support Unicode; thus, no Chinese characters or non-ASCII characters can be used with the tool.
