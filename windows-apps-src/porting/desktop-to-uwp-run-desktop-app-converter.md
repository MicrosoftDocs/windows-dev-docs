# Package a desktop application using the Desktop App Converter

[Get the Desktop App Converter](https://aka.ms/converter)

The Desktop App Converter (DAC) creates packages for desktop applications to integrate with the latest Windows features, including distribution and servicing via the Microsoft Store. This includes Win32 apps and apps that you've created by using .NET 4.6.1.

![DAC Icon](images/desktop-to-uwp/dac.png)

While the term "Converter" appears in the name of this tool, it doesn't actually convert your app. Your application remains unchanged. However, this tool generates a Windows app package with a package identity and the ability to call a vast range of WinRT APIs.

You can install that package by using the Add-AppxPackage PowerShell cmdlet on your development machine.

The converter runs the desktop installer in an isolated Windows environment by using a clean base image provided as part of the converter download. It captures any registry and file system I/O made by the desktop installer and packages it as part of the output.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The ability to create a Windows app package for your desktop application (otherwise known as the Desktop Bridge) was introduced in Windows 10, version 1607, and it can only be used in projects that target Windows 10 Anniversary Update (10.0; Build 14393) or a later release in Visual Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> Checkout <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/developers-guide-to-the-desktop-bridge-17373?l=oZG0B1WhD_8406218965/">this series</a> of short videos published by the Microsoft Virtual Academy. These videos walk you through some common ways to use the Desktop App Converter.

## The DAC does more than just generate a package for you

Here's a few extra things it can do for you.

**Windows 10 Creators Update**

:heavy_check_mark: Automatically register your preview handlers, thumbnail handlers, property handlers, firewall rules, URL flags.

:heavy_check_mark: Automatically register file type mappings that enable users to group files by using the **Kind** column in File Explorer.

:heavy_check_mark: Register your public COM servers.

**Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later**

:heavy_check_mark: Automatically sign your package so that you can test your app.

:heavy_check_mark: Validate your application against packaged app and Microsoft Store requirements.

To find a complete list of options, see the [Parameters](#command-reference) section of this guide.

If you're ready to create your package, let's start.

## First, prepare your application

Review this guide before you begin creating a package for your application: [Prepare to package a desktop application](desktop-to-uwp-prepare.md).

## Make sure that your system can run the converter

Make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

* Windows 10 Anniversary Update (10.0.14393.0 and later) Pro or Enterprise edition.
* 64 bit (x64) processor
* Hardware-assisted virtualization
* Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
* [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=821375).

## Start the Desktop App Converter

1. Download and install the [Desktop App Converter](https://aka.ms/converter).

2. Run the Desktop App Converter as an administrator.

    ![run DAC as administrator](images/desktop-to-uwp/run-converter.png)

   A console window appears. You'll use that console window to run commands.

## Set a few things up (apps with installers only)

You can skip ahead to the next section if your application doesn't have an installer.

1. Identify the version number of your operating system.

   To do that, type **winver** in the **Run** dialog box, and then choose the **OK** button.

   ![winver](images/desktop-to-uwp/winver.png)

   You'll find the version of your Windows build in the **About Windows** dialog box.

   ![Windows 10 version](images/desktop-to-uwp/win-10-version.png)

2. Download the appropriate [Desktop app Converter base image](https://aka.ms/converterimages).

   Make sure that the version number that appears in the name of the file matches the version number of your Windows build.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > If you're using build number **15063**, and the minor version of that build is equal to or greater than **.483** (For example: **15063.540**), make sure to download the **BaseImage-15063-UPDATE.wim** file. If the minor version of that build is less than **.483**, download the **BaseImage-15063.wim** file. If you've already setup an incompatible version of this base file, you can fix it. This [blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2017/08/04/desktop-app-converter-fails-on-windows-10-15063-483-and-later-how-to-solve-it/) explains how to do that.

3. Place the downloaded file anywhere on your computer where you'll be able to find it later.

4. In the console window that appeared when you started the Desktop App Converter, run this command: ```Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass```.
5. Set up the converter by running  this command: ```DesktopAppConverter.exe -Setup -BaseImage .\BaseImage-1XXXX.wim -Verbose```.
6. Restart your computer if you're prompted to do so.

   Status messages appear in the console window as the converter expands the base image. If you don't see any status messages, press any key. This can cause the contents of the console window to refresh.

   ![status messages in the console window](images/desktop-to-uwp/bas-image-setup.png)

   When the base image is fully expanded, move to the next section.

## Package an app

To Package your app, run the ``DesktopAppConverter.exe`` command in the console window that opened when you started the Desktop App Converter.  

You'll specify the package name, publisher and version number of the application by using parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've reserved your app name in the Microsoft Store, you can obtain the package and publisher names by using [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard). If you plan to sideload your app onto other systems, you can provide your own names for these as long as the publisher name that you choose matches the name on the certificate you use to sign your app.

### A quick look at command parameters

Here are the required parameters.

```CMD
DesktopAppConverter.exe
-Installer <String>
-Destination <String>
-PackageName <String>
-Publisher <String>
-Version <Version>
```
You can read about each one [here](#command-reference).

### Examples

Here's a few common ways to package your app.

* [Package an application that has an installer (.msi) file](#installer-conversion)
* [Package an application that has a setup executable file](#setup-conversion)
* [Package an application that doesn't have an installer](#no-installer-conversion)
* [Package an app, sign the app, and prepare it for Store submission](#optional-parameters)

<a id="installer-conversion" />

#### Package an application that has an installer (.msi) file

Point to the installer file by using the ``Installer`` parameter.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyAppSetup.msi -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are two important things to keep in mind here. First, make sure that your installer is located in an independent folder and that only files related to that installer are in the same folder. The converter copies all of the contents of that folder to the isolated Windows environment. <br> Secondly, if Partner Center assigns an identity to your package that begins with a number, make sure that you also pass in the <i>-AppId</i> parameter, and use only the string suffix (after the period separator) as the value of that parameter.  

**Video**

If your installer includes installers for dependent libraries or frameworks, you might have to organize things a bit a differently. See [Chaining multiple installers with the Desktop Bridge](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2017/09/11/chaining-multiple-installers-with-the-desktop-app-converter/).

<a id="setup-conversion" />

#### Package an application that has a setup executable file

Point to the setup executable by using the ``Installer`` parameter.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyAppSetup.exe -InstallerArguments "/S" -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
>If Partner Center assigns an identity to your package that begins with a number, make sure that you also pass in the <i>-AppId</i> parameter, and use only the string suffix (after the period separator) as the value of that parameter.

The ``InstallerArguments`` parameter is an optional parameter. However, because the Desktop App Converter needs your installer to run in unattended mode, you might have to use it if your application needs silent flags to run silently. The ``/S`` flag is a very common silent flag, but the flag that you use might be different depending on which installer technology you used to create the setup file.

<a id="no-installer-conversion" />

#### Package an application that doesn't have an installer

In this example, use the ``Installer`` parameter to point to the root folder of your application files.

Use the `AppExecutable` parameter to point to your apps executable file.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyApp\ -AppExecutable MyApp.exe -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If Partner Center assigns an identity to your package that begins with a number, make sure that you also pass in the <i>-AppId</i> parameter, and use only the string suffix (after the period separator) as the value of that parameter.

<a id="optional-parameters" />

#### Package an app, sign the app, and run validation checks on the package

This example is similar to first one except it shows how you can sign your application for local testing, and then validate your application against packaged app and Microsoft Store requirements.

```cmd
DesktopAppConverter.exe -Installer C:\Installer\MyAppSetup.exe -InstallerArguments "/S" -Destination C:\Output\MyApp -PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=MyPublisher" -Version 0.0.0.1 -MakeAppx -Sign -Verbose -Verify
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
>If Partner Center assigns an identity to your package that begins with a number, make sure that you also pass in the <i>-AppId</i> parameter, and use only the string suffix (after the period separator) as the value of that parameter.

The ``Sign`` parameter generates a certificate and then signs your application with it. To run your app, you'll have to install that generated certificate. To learn how, see the [Run the packaged app](#run-app) section of this guide.

You can validate you application by using the ``Verify`` parameter.

### A quick look at optional parameters

The ``Sign`` and ``Verify`` parameters are optional. There are many more optional parameters.  Here are some of the more commonly used optional parameters.

```CMD
[-ExpandedBaseImage <String>]
[-AppExecutable <String>]
[-AppFileTypes <String>]
[-AppId <String>]
[-AppDisplayName <String>]
[-AppDescription <String>]
[-PackageDisplayName <String>]
[-PackagePublisherDisplayName <String>]
[-MakeAppx]
[-LogFile <String>]
[<CommonParameters>]
```
You can read about all of them in the next section.

<a id="command-reference" />

<a id="run-app" />

## Run the packaged app

There's two ways to run your app.

One way is to open a PowerShell command prompt, and then type this command: ```Add-AppxPackage –Register AppxManifest.xml```. It's probably the easiest way to run your application because you don't have to sign it.

Another way is to sign your application with a certificate. If you use the ```sign``` parameter, the Desktop App Converter will generate one for you, and then sign your application with it. That file is named **auto-generated.cer**, and you can find it in the root folder of your packaged app.

Follow these steps to install the generated certificate, and then run your app.

1. Double-click the **auto-generated.cer** file to install the certificate.

   ![generated certificate file](images/desktop-to-uwp/generated-cert-file.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're prompted for a password, use the default password "123456".

2. In the **Certificate** dialog box, choose the **Install Certificate** button.
3. In the **Certificate Import Wizard**, install the certificate onto the **Local Machine**, and place the certificate into the **Trusted People** certificate store.

   ![Trusted People Store](images/desktop-to-uwp/trusted-people-store.png)

5. In root folder of your packaged app, double click the Windows app package file.

   ![Windows app package file](images/desktop-to-uwp/windows-app-package.png)

6. Install the app, by choosing the **Install** button.

   ![Install button](images/desktop-to-uwp/install.png)


## Modify the packaged app

You'll likely make changes to your packaged application to address bugs, add visual assets, or enhance your application with modern experiences such as live tiles.

After you make your changes, you don't need to run the converter again. In most cases, you can just repackage your application by using the MakeAppx tool and the appxmanifest.xml file the DAC generates for your app. See [Generate a Windows app package](desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion.md#make-appx).

* If you modify any of the visual assets of your app, generate a new Package Resource Index file, and then run the MakeAppx tool to generate a new package. See [Generate a Package Resource Index (PRI) file](desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion.md#make-pri).

* If you want to add icons or tiles that appear on the Windows taskbar, task view, LT+TAB, snap assist, and the lower right corner of Start tiles, see [(Optional Add Target-based unplated assets](desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion.md#target-based-assets).

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes to registry settings that your installer makes, you will have to run the Desktop App Converter again to pick up those changes.

The following two sections describe a couple of optional fix-ups to the packaged application that you might consider.

### Delete unnecessary files and registry keys

The desktop App Converter takes a very conservative approach to filtering out files and system noise in the container.

If you want, you can review the VFS folder and delete any files that your installer doesn't need.  You can also review the contents of Reg.dat and delete any keys that are not installed/needed by the app.

### Fix corrupted PE headers

During the conversion process, the DesktopAppConverter automatically runs the PEHeaderCertFixTool to fixup any corrupted PE headers. However, you can also run the PEHeaderCertFixTool on a UWP Windows app package, loose files, or a specific binary. Here's an example.

```CMD
PEHeaderCertFixTool.exe <binary file>|<.appx package>|<folder> [/c] [/v]
 /c   -- check for corrupted certificate but do not fix (optional)
 /v   -- verbose (optional)
example1: PEHeaderCertFixTool app.exe
example2: PEHeaderCertFixTool c:\package.appx /c
example3: PEHeaderCertFixTool c:\myapp /c /v
```

## Telemetry from Desktop App Converter

Desktop App Converter may collect information about you and your use of the software and send this info to Microsoft. You can learn more about Microsoft's data collection and use in the product documentation and in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

By default, telemetry will be enabled for the Desktop App Converter. Add the following registry key to configure telemetry to a desired setting:  

```cmd
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DesktopAppConverter
```
+ Add or edit the *DisableTelemetry* value by using a DWORD set to 1.
+ To enable telemetry, remove the key or set the value to 0.

### Language support

The Desktop App Converter does not support Unicode; thus, no Chinese characters or non-ASCII characters can be used with the tool.
