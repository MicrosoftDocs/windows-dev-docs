# Move from iOS to UWP

If you are an iOS developer wondering how to expand your user base to include Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), there are a growing number of tools to help you. The approaches you can take depend on the type of app you are working on (game, lifestyle, enterprise, and so on) and how far along you are in the development process. For example, a completed or nearly completed game that is heavily dependent on OpenGL or Cocos2D is an ideal candidate for the [Windows Bridge for iOS](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/bridges/ios), whereas if you are planning a cross-platform app for a small business, you should be considering using [Xamarin.Forms](/xamarin/xamarin-forms/). And if you have written your app in a cross-platform tool such as Unity, [publishing to Windows](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/09/09/windows-10-universal-apps-in-unity-5-2/) is quite straightforward.

## Why Windows?

Today, Windows is running on a huge number of devices. The UWP provides developers with a set of modern APIs, designed to create beautifully responsive user interfaces across devices as diverse as desktop computers, games consoles and holographic displays. With one Visual Studio solution, and with user interface controls that are smart enough to automatically optimize themselves for multiple platforms , you'll often find that you are writing less code and running it on more hardware.
