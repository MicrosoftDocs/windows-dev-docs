# Setting up your Mac with Windows 10


Use your current Mac computer to develop apps for Windows.

## Run Windows on your Mac and use Visual Studio

Are you ready to start developing Universal Windows apps, but you don't have a PC handy? That's okay — you can use your Mac! With popular third-party solutions like Apple Boot Camp, Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, and Parallels Desktop, you can install Windows 10 and Microsoft Visual Studio on your Apple computer.

**Note**  You will need a Windows 10 bootable image on disk or USB flash drive. If you are a MSDN Subscriber, you can download the install image from the MSDN Subscriber Downloads center. If you aren't a subscriber, the installer can be purchased from the [Microsoft Store](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app). You can also download it from [this location](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=623906), which is useful if you are already running Windows and wish to upgrade.

Once you have Windows running, you can then install the latest release of Visual Studio from [Developer downloads for Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads) and start writing apps!

**Note**  If you plan to use the Visual Studio device emulators, you **must** install a 64-bit (x64) version of Windows 10 Pro or better. Unfortunately, some older Macs cannot run 64-bit Windows. Please check with Apple if your hardware is compatible on this[Apple support page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=397959).

## Apple Boot Camp

The Boot Camp Assistant app is pre-installed on every recent Mac, and launching it will walk you through the process of installing Windows 10. All you need is a copy of Windows (from the sources listed above) and at least 30 Gb of free disk space. Once installed, you can choose to boot into Mac OSX or Windows 10. For more info, see Apple's [Boot Camp instructions page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=623912).

## Parallels Desktop

Using Parallels Desktop 11, you can run Windows apps side-by-side with existing Mac applications, including Visual Studio and Cortana. A pro version is available that includes extra features for developers, including improved debugging, and support for Docker and Jenkins. For more info, and a free trial version, see [Parallels Desktop](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=281827).

## VMWare Fusion

Fusion 8 from VMWare will let you run Visual Studio right on your Mac desktop. A pro version is available to offer developers some more advanced features such as vSphere support. For more info, and a free trial version, see [VMware Fusion](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=281826).

## Oracle VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a free application for running virtual machines on your computer, and it supports running Windows on Mac. It is a no-frills option, but the price is appealing. For more info, see [VirtualBox](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=280599).
