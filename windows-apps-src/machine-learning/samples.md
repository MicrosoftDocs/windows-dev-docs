# Windows Machine Learning samples

The following sample UWP apps demonstrate how to use Windows Machine Learning and are available to download from the [Windows-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning) repo on GitHub.

## MNIST Multilayer Perceptron

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/MNIST) uses the CNTK MNIST model to interpret a numeric digit drawn by the user. You can walk through the sample with a step-by-step tutorial in [Get Started](get-started.md).

## SqueezeNet Image Classifier

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/SqueezeNetObjectDetection) detects the predominant object in an image.

## Windows Machine Learning Explorer

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/WinMLExplorer) is a data driven and generic application that bootstraps ML models, such as circuit board defect detection model, to detect defects with pictures and a real-time camera feed of a printed circuit board.
