# Windows ML samples

The following sample UWP apps demonstrate how to use Windows ML and are available to download from the [Windows-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning) repo on GitHub.

## MNIST Multilayer Perceptron

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/MNIST) uses the CNTK MNIST model to interpret a numeric digit drawn by the user. You can walk through the sample with a step-by-step tutorial in [Get Started](get-started.md).

## SqueezeNet Image Classifier

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/SqueezeNetObjectDetection) detects the predominant object in an image.

## Windows Machine Learning Explorer

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/WinMLExplorer) is a data driven and generic application that bootstraps ML models that can detect defects in circuit boards from pictures or a real-time camera feed. You can learn more in the blog post [How three lines of code and Windows Machine Learning empower .NET developers to run AI locally on Windows 10 devices](https://aka.ms/winmlfordevsblog).
