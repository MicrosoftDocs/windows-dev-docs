# Windows ML

Windows Machine Learning (ML) allows you to use trained machine learning models in your applications. The platform evaluates trained models locally on Windows 10 devices, providing hardware-accelerated performance by leveraging the device's CPU or GPU, and computes evaluations for both classical ML algorithms and Deep Learning.
