# Manage add-ons

Use the following methods in the Microsoft Store submission API to manage add-ons for your apps. For an introduction to the Microsoft Store submission API, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Create and manage submissions using Microsoft Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

These methods can only be used to get, create, or delete add-ons. To create submissions for add-ons, see the methods in [Manage add-on submissions](manage-add-on-submissions.md).

<span id="add-on-object" />

### Add-on resource

This resource describes an add-on.

```json
{
  "applications": {
    "value": [
      {
        "id": "9NBLGGH4R315",
        "resourceLocation": "applications/9NBLGGH4R315"
      }
    ],
    "totalCount": 1
  },
  "id": "9NBLGGH4TNMP",
  "productId": "TestAddOn",
  "productType": "Durable",
  "pendingInAppProductSubmission": {
    "id": "1152921504621243619",
    "resourceLocation": "inappproducts/9NBLGGH4TNMP/submissions/1152921504621243619"
  },
  "lastPublishedInAppProductSubmission": {

```

This resource has the following values.

| Value      | Type   | Description        |
|------------|--------|--------------|

| id | string  | The Store ID of the add-on. This value is supplied by the Store. An example Store ID is 9NBLGGH4TNMP.  |
| productId | string  | The product ID of the add-on. This is the ID that was provided by the developer when the add-on was created. For more information, see [Set your product type and product ID](../publish/set-your-add-on-product-id.md). |
| productType | string  | The product type of the add-on. The following values are supported: **Durable** and **Consumable**.  |
| lastPublishedInAppProductSubmission       | object | A [submission resource](#submission-object) that provides information about the last published submission for the add-on.         |
| pendingInAppProductSubmission        | object  |  A [submission resource](#submission-object) that provides information about the current pending submission for the add-on.  |   |
