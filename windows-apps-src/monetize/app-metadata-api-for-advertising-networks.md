# App metadata API for advertising networks

Advertising networks can use the *app metadata API* to programmatically retrieve metadata about apps in the Microsoft Store, including details such as the description and category for the Store listing of the app and whether the app is targeted to children under 13. Access to this API is currently restricted to developers who are granted permission to the API by Microsoft.

This article provides instructions for how to request access to the API using the [app metadata API portal](https://admetadata.portal.azure-api.net/), how to get your subscription key to access the API, and how to call the API.

## Request access

Advertising networks can request access to the app metadata API by following these instructions:

1. Go to the [https://admetadata.portal.azure-api.net/signup](https://admetadata.portal.azure-api.net/signup) page of the app metadata API portal.
2. Enter the required information and click the **Sign up** button.
3. On the same site, click the **Products** tab and then click **App details for advertising**.
4. On the next page, click the **Subscribe** button. This submits your request to access the app metadata API to Microsoft.

After your request is submitted, you will receive an email within approximately 24 hours that notifies you if your request was granted or denied.

## Get your subscription key

If you are granted access to the app metadata API, follow these instructions to get your subscription key. You must pass this key in the request header of calls to the API.

1. Go to the [https://admetadata.portal.azure-api.net/signin](https://admetadata.portal.azure-api.net/signin) page of the app metadata API portal and sign in with your email and password.
2. Click your name in the top-right corner of the site and then click **Profile**.
3. In the **Your subscriptions** section of the page, click **Show** next to **Primary key**. This is your subscription key. Copy the key so you can use it later when you call the API.

## Call the API

After you have your subscription key, you are ready to call the API using HTTP REST syntax from the programming language of your choice. For information about the syntax of the API, see the [API syntax](#syntax) section below. To see code examples in C#, JavaScript, Python, and several other languages, click the **APIs** tab of the app metadata API portal, click **App details**, and then see the **Code samples** section on the bottom of the page.

Alternatively, you can call the API using the UI provided by the app metadata API portal:
  1. In the portal, click the **APIs** tab and then click **App details**.
  2. On the following page, enter the [app_id](#request-parameters) of the app for which you want to retrieve metadata in the **app_id** field and enter your subscription key in the **Ocp_Apim_Subscription-Key** field.
  3. Click **Send**. The response appears at the bottom of the page.
