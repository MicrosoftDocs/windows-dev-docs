# Banner ads

>[!WARNING]
> As of June 1, 2020, the Microsoft Ad Monetization platform for Windows UWP apps will be shut down. [Learn more](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/db8d44cb-1381-47f7-94d3-c6ded3fea36f/microsoft-ad-monetization-platform-shutting-down-june-1st?forum=aiamgr)

The articles in this section show how to use the [AdControl](/uwp/api/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol) class in the Microsoft Advertising SDK to add banner ads to your UWP app.

Banner ads are static display ads that utilize a rectangular portion of a page in your app to display promotional content. These ads can refresh automatically at regular intervals. This is a good place to start if you are new to advertising in your app.
