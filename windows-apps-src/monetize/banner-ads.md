# Banner ads

The articles in this section show how to use the [AdControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.aspx) class in the Microsoft Advertising SDK to add banner ads to your UWP app.

Banner ads are static display ads that utilize a rectangular portion of a page in your app to display promotional content. These ads can refresh automatically at regular intervals. This is a good place to start if you are new to advertising in your app.
