---# Manage creatives for ad campaignsUse these methods in the Windows Store promotions API to upload your own custom creatives to use in promotional ad campaigns or get an existing creative. A creative may be associated with one or more delivery lines, even across ad campaigns, provided it always represents the same app.For more information about the relationship between creatives and ad campaigns, delivery lines, and targeting profiles, see [Run ad campaigns using Windows Store services](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#call-the-windows-store-promotions-api).## PrerequisitesTo use these methods, you need to first do the following:* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Windows Store promotions API.* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for these methods. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.## RequestThese methods have the following URIs.| Method type | Request URI     |  Description  ||--------|-----------------------------|---------------|| POST   | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/promotion/creative``` |  Creates a new creative.  || GET    | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/promotion/creative/{creativeId}``` |  Gets the creative specified by *creativeId*.  |>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;This API currently does not support a PUT method.<span/> ### Header| Header        | Type   | Description         ||---------------|--------|---------------------|| Authorization | string | Required. The Azure AD access token in the form **Bearer** &lt;*token*&gt;. || Tracking ID   | GUID   | Optional. An ID that tracks the call flow.                                  |<span/>### Request bodyThe POST method requires a JSON request body with the required fields of a [Creative](#creative) object.<span/>### Request examplesThe following example demonstrates how to call the POST method to create a creative. In this example, the *content* value has been shortened for brevity.```jsonPOST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/promotion/creative HTTP/1.1Authorization: Bearer <your access token>{  "name": "Contoso App Campaign - Creative 1",  "content": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAAQABAAD/2wBDAAgGB...other base64 data shortened for brevity...",  "height": 80,  "width": 480,  "imageAttributes":  {    "imageExtension": "PNG"  }}```The following example demonstrates how to call the GET method to retrieve a creative.```jsonGET https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/promotion/creative/106851  HTTP/1.1Authorization: Bearer <your access token>```<span/>## ResponseThese methods return a JSON response body with a [Creative](#creative) object that contains information about the creative that was created or retrieved. The following example demonstrates a response body for these methods. In this example, the *content* value has been shortened for brevity.```json{    "Data": {        "id": 106126,        "name": "Contoso App Campaign - Creative 2",        "content": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAAQABAAD/2wBDAAgGB...other base64 data shortened for brevity...",        "height": 50,        "width": 300,        "format": "Banner",        "imageAttributes":        {          "imageExtension": "PNG"        },        "storeProductId": "9nblggh42cfd"    }}```<span id="creative"/>## Creative objectThe request and response bodies for these methods contain the following fields.
