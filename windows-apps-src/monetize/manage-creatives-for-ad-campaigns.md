# Manage creatives

Use these methods in the Microsoft Store promotions API to upload your own custom creatives to use in promotional ad campaigns or get an existing creative. A creative may be associated with one or more delivery lines, even across ad campaigns, provided it always represents the same app.

For more information about the relationship between creatives and ad campaigns, delivery lines, and targeting profiles, see [Run ad campaigns using Microsoft Store services](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#call-the-windows-store-promotions-api).

> [!NOTE]
> When using this API to upload your own creative, the maximum allowed size for your creative is 40 KB. If you submit a creative file larger than this, this API will not return an error, but the campaign will not successfully be created.

## Prerequisites

To use these methods, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store promotions API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for these methods. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
