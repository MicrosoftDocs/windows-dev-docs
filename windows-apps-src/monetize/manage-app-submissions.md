# Manage app submissions

The Microsoft Store submission API provides methods you can use to manage submissions for your apps, including gradual package rollouts. For an introduction to the Microsoft Store submission API, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Create and manage submissions using Microsoft Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the Microsoft Store submission API to create a submission for an app, be sure to make further changes to the submission only by using the API, rather than Partner Center. If you use Partner Center to change a submission that you originally created by using the API, you will no longer be able to change or commit that submission by using the API. In some cases, the submission could be left in an error state where it cannot proceed in the submission process. If this occurs, you must delete the submission and create a new submission.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot use this API to publish submissions for [volume purchases through the Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education](../publish/organizational-licensing.md) or to publish submissions for [LOB apps](../publish/distribute-lob-apps-to-enterprises.md) directly to enterprises. For both of these scenarios, you must use Partner Center to publish the submission.

## Methods for managing app submissions

Use the following methods to get, create, update, commit, or delete an app submission. Before you can use these methods, the app must already exist in your Partner Center account and you must first create one submission for the app in Partner Center. For more information, see the [prerequisites](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites).

### Create an app submission

To create a submission for an app, follow this process.

1. If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store submission API.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure the app already has at least one completed submission with the [age ratings](../publish/age-ratings.md) information completed.

2. [Obtain an Azure AD access token](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token). You must pass this access token to the methods in the Microsoft Store submission API. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.

3. [Create an app submission](create-an-app-submission.md) by executing the following method in the Microsoft Store submission API. This method creates a new in-progress submission, which is a copy of your last published submission.

    ```json
    POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions
    ```

    The response body contains an [app submission](#app-submission-object) resource that includes the ID of the new submission, the shared access signature (SAS) URI for uploading any related files for the submission to Azure Blob storage (such as app packages, listing images, and trailer files), and all of the data for the new submission (such as the listings and pricing information).

    > [!NOTE]
    > A SAS URI provides access to a secure resource in Azure storage without requiring account keys. For background information about SAS URIs and their use with Azure Blob storage, see [Shared Access Signatures, Part 1: Understanding the SAS model](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) and [Shared Access Signatures, Part 2: Create and use a SAS with Blob storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview).

4. If you are adding new packages, listing images, or trailer files for the submission, [prepare the app packages](../publish/app-package-requirements.md) and [prepare the app screenshots, images, and trailers](../publish/app-screenshots-and-images.md). Add all of these files to a ZIP archive.

5. Revise the [app submission](#app-submission-object) data with any required changes for the new submission, and execute the following method to [update the app submission](update-an-app-submission.md).

    ```json
    PUT https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}
    ```
      > [!NOTE]
      > If you are adding new files for the submission, make sure you update the submission data to refer to the name and relative path of these files in the ZIP archive.

4. If you are adding new packages, listing images, or trailer files for the submission, upload the ZIP archive to [Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/storage-introduction#blob-storage) using the SAS URI that was provided in the response body of the POST method you called earlier. There are different Azure libraries you can use to do this on a variety of platforms, including:

    * [Azure Storage Client Library for .NET](/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs)
    * [Azure Storage SDK for Java](/azure/storage/storage-java-how-to-use-blob-storage)
    * [Azure Storage SDK for Python](/azure/storage/storage-python-how-to-use-blob-storage)

    The following C# code example demonstrates how to upload a ZIP archive to Azure Blob storage using the [CloudBlockBlob](/dotnet/api/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob.cloudblockblob) class in the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET. This example assumes that the ZIP archive has already been written to a stream object.

    ```csharp
    string sasUrl = "https://productingestionbin1.blob.core.windows.net/ingestion/26920f66-b592-4439-9a9d-fb0f014902ec?sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=usAN0kNFNnYE2tGQBI%2BARQWejX1Guiz7hdFtRhyK%2Bog%3D&se=2016-06-17T20:45:51Z&sp=rwl";
    Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob blockBob =
        new Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob(new System.Uri(sasUrl));
    await blockBob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
    ```

5. [Commit the app submission](commit-an-app-submission.md) by executing the following method. This will alert Partner Center that you are done with your submission and that your updates should now be applied to your account.

    ```json
    POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}/commit
    ```

6. Check on the commit status by executing the following method to [get the status of the app submission](get-status-for-an-app-submission.md).

    ```json
    GET https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}/status
    ```

    To confirm the submission status, review the *status* value in the response body. This value should change from **CommitStarted** to either **PreProcessing** if the request succeeds or to **CommitFailed** if there are errors in the request. If there are errors, the *statusDetails* field contains further details about the error.

7. After the commit has successfully completed, the submission is sent to the Store for ingestion. You can continue to monitor the submission progress by using the previous method, or by visiting Partner Center.

## Methods for managing a gradual package rollout

You can gradually roll out the updated packages in an app submission to a percentage of your app’s customers on Windows 10. This allows you to monitor feedback and analytic data for the specific packages to make sure you’re confident about the update before rolling it out more broadly. You can change the rollout percentage (or halt the update) for a published submission without having to create a new submission. For more details, including instructions for how to enable and manage a gradual package rollout in Partner Center, see [this article](../publish/gradual-package-rollout.md).

To programmatically enable a gradual package rollout for an app submission, follow this process using methods in the Microsoft Store submission API:

  1. [Create an app submission](create-an-app-submission.md) or [get an existing app submission](get-an-app-submission.md).
  2. In the response data, locate the [packageRollout](#package-rollout-object) resource, set the *isPackageRollout* field to **true**, and set the *packageRolloutPercentage* field to the percentage of your app's customers who should get the updated packages.
  3. Pass the updated app submission data to the [update an app submission](update-an-app-submission.md) method.

After a gradual package rollout is enabled for an app submission, you can use the following methods to programmatically get, update, halt, or finalize the gradual rollout.

## Code examples for managing app submissions

The following articles provide detailed code examples that demonstrate how to create an app submission in several different programming languages:

* [C# sample: submissions for apps, add-ons, and flights](csharp-code-examples-for-the-windows-store-submission-api.md)
* [C# sample: app submission with game options and trailers](csharp-code-examples-for-submissions-game-options-and-trailers.md)
* [Java sample: submissions for apps, add-ons, and flights](java-code-examples-for-the-windows-store-submission-api.md)
* [Java sample: app submission with game options and trailers](java-code-examples-for-submissions-game-options-and-trailers.md)
* [Python sample: submissions for apps, add-ons, and flights](python-code-examples-for-the-windows-store-submission-api.md)
* [Python sample: app submission with game options and trailers](python-code-examples-for-submissions-game-options-and-trailers.md)

## StoreBroker PowerShell module

As an alternative to calling the Microsoft Store submission API directly, we also provide an open-source PowerShell module which implements a command-line interface on top of the API. This module is called [StoreBroker](https://github.com/Microsoft/StoreBroker). You can use this module to manage your app, flight, and add-on submissions from the command line instead of calling the Microsoft Store submission API directly, or you can simply browse the source to see more examples for how to call this API. The StoreBroker module is actively used within Microsoft as the primary way that many first-party applications are submitted to the Store.

For more information, see our [StoreBroker page on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/StoreBroker).
