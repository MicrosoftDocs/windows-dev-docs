# Manage add-on submissions

The Microsoft Store submission API provides methods you can use to manage add-on (also known as in-app product or IAP) submissions for your apps. For an introduction to the Microsoft Store submission API, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Create and manage submissions using Microsoft Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the Microsoft Store submission API to create a submission for an add-on, be sure to make further changes to the submission only by using the API, rather than making changes in Partner Center. If you use Partner Center to change a submission that you originally created by using the API, you will no longer be able to change or commit that submission by using the API. In some cases, the submission could be left in an error state where it cannot proceed in the submission process. If this occurs, you must delete the submission and create a new submission.

<span id="methods-for-add-on-submissions" />

## Methods for managing add-on submissions

Use the following methods to get, create, update, commit, or delete an add-on submission. Before you can use these methods, the add-on must already exist in your Partner Center account. You can create an add-on in Partner Center by [defining its product type and product ID](../publish/set-your-add-on-product-id.md) or by using the Microsoft Store submission API methods in described in [Manage add-ons](manage-add-ons.md).

## Create an add-on submission

To create a submission for an add-on, follow this process.

1. If you have not yet done so, complete the prerequisites described in [Create and manage submissions using Microsoft Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md), including associating an Azure AD application with your Partner Center account and obtaining your client ID and key. You only need to do this one time; after you have the client ID and key, you can reuse them any time you need to create a new Azure AD access token.  

2. [Obtain an Azure AD access token](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token). You must pass this access token to the methods in the Microsoft Store submission API. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.

3. Execute the following method in the Microsoft Store submission API. This method creates a new in-progress submission, which is a copy of your last published submission. For more information, see [Create an add-on submission](create-an-add-on-submission.md).

    ```json
    POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions
    ```

    The response body contains an [add-on submission](#add-on-submission-object) resource that includes the ID of the new submission, the shared access signature (SAS) URI for uploading any add-on icons for the submission to Azure Blob storage, and all of the data for the new submission (such as the listings and pricing information).

    > [!NOTE]
    > A SAS URI provides access to a secure resource in Azure storage without requiring account keys. For background information about SAS URIs and their use with Azure Blob storage, see [Shared Access Signatures, Part 1: Understanding the SAS model](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) and [Shared Access Signatures, Part 2: Create and use a SAS with Blob storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview).

4. If you are adding new icons for the submission, [prepare the icons](../publish/create-add-on-store-listings.md) and add them to a ZIP archive.

5. Update the [add-on submission](#add-on-submission-object) data with any required changes for the new submission, and execute the following method to update the submission. For more information, see [Update an add-on submission](update-an-add-on-submission.md).

    ```json
    PUT https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}
    ```
      > [!NOTE]
      > If you are adding new icons for the submission, make sure you update the submission data to refer to the name and relative path of these files in the ZIP archive.

4. If you are adding new icons for the submission, upload the ZIP archive to [Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/storage-introduction#blob-storage) using the SAS URI that was provided in the response body of the POST method you called earlier. There are different Azure libraries you can use to do this on a variety of platforms, including:

    * [Azure Storage Client Library for .NET](/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs)
    * [Azure Storage SDK for Java](/azure/storage/storage-java-how-to-use-blob-storage)
    * [Azure Storage SDK for Python](/azure/storage/storage-python-how-to-use-blob-storage)

    The following C# code example demonstrates how to upload a ZIP archive to Azure Blob storage using the [CloudBlockBlob](/dotnet/api/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob.cloudblockblob) class in the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET. This example assumes that the ZIP archive has already been written to a stream object.

    ```csharp
    string sasUrl = "https://productingestionbin1.blob.core.windows.net/ingestion/26920f66-b592-4439-9a9d-fb0f014902ec?sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=usAN0kNFNnYE2tGQBI%2BARQWejX1Guiz7hdFtRhyK%2Bog%3D&se=2016-06-17T20:45:51Z&sp=rwl";
    Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob blockBob =
      new Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob(new System.Uri(sasUrl));
    await blockBob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
    ```

5. Commit the submission by executing the following method. This will alert Partner Center that you are done with your submission and that your updates should now be applied to your account. For more information, see [Commit an add-on submission](commit-an-add-on-submission.md).

    ```json
    POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}/commit
    ```

6. Check on the commit status by executing the following method. For more information, see [Get the status of an add-on submission](get-status-for-an-add-on-submission.md).

    ```json
    GET https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}/status
    ```

    To confirm the submission status, review the *status* value in the response body. This value should change from **CommitStarted** to either **PreProcessing** if the request succeeds or to **CommitFailed** if there are errors in the request. If there are errors, the *statusDetails* field contains further details about the error.

7. After the commit has successfully completed, the submission is sent to the Store for ingestion. You can continue to monitor the submission progress by using the previous method, or by visiting Partner Center.

## Code examples

The following articles provide detailed code examples that demonstrate how to create an add-on submission in several different programming languages:

* [C# code examples](csharp-code-examples-for-the-windows-store-submission-api.md)
* [Java code examples](java-code-examples-for-the-windows-store-submission-api.md)
* [Python code examples](python-code-examples-for-the-windows-store-submission-api.md)

## StoreBroker PowerShell module

As an alternative to calling the Microsoft Store submission API directly, we also provide an open-source PowerShell module which implements a command-line interface on top of the API. This module is called [StoreBroker](https://github.com/Microsoft/StoreBroker). You can use this module to manage your app, flight, and add-on submissions from the command line instead of calling the Microsoft Store submission API directly, or you can simply browse the source to see more examples for how to call this API. The StoreBroker module is actively used within Microsoft as the primary way that many first-party applications are submitted to the Store.

For more information, see our [StoreBroker page on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/StoreBroker).
