# Commit an add-on submission

Use this method in the Microsoft Store submission API to commit a new or updated add-on (also known as in-app product or IAP) submission to Partner Center. The commit action alerts Partner Center that the submission data has been uploaded (including any related icons). In response, Partner Center commits the changes to the submission data for ingestion and publishing. After the commit operation succeeds, the changes to the submission are shown in Partner Center.

For more information about how the commit operation fits into the process of submitting an add-on by using the Microsoft Store submission API, see [Manage add-on submissions](manage-add-on-submissions.md).

## Prerequisites

To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store submission API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* [Create an add-on submission](create-an-add-on-submission.md) and then [update the submission](update-an-add-on-submission.md) with any necessary changes to the submission data.
