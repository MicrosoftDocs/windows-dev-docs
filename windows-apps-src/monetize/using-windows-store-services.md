| [Manage product entitlements from a service](view-and-grant-products-from-a-service.md)  | If you have a catalog of apps and add-ons in the Store, you can use the *Microsoft Store collection API* and *Microsoft Store purchase API* to access ownership information for these products from your services, report a consumable product as fulfilled for a user, and grant an entitlement for a free product to a user.  |
| [App metadata API for advertising networks](app-metadata-api-for-advertising-networks.md)  | Advertising networks can use this API to programmatically retrieve metadata about apps in the Microsoft Store, including details such as the description and category for the Store listing of the app and whether the app is targeted to children under 13. Access to this API is currently restricted to developers who are granted permission by Microsoft.  |
