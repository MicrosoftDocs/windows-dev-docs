# Get response info for reviews

If you want to programmatically respond to a customer review of your app, you can use this method in the Microsoft Store reviews API to first determine whether you have permission to respond to the review. You cannot respond to reviews submitted by customers who have chosen not to receive review responses. After you confirm that you can respond to the review, you can then use the [submit responses to app reviews](submit-responses-to-app-reviews.md) method to programmatically respond to it.


## Prerequisites

To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](respond-to-reviews-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store analytics API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](respond-to-reviews-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* Get the ID of the review you want to check to determine whether you can respond to it. Review IDs are available in the response data of the [get app reviews](get-app-reviews.md) method in the Microsoft Store analytics API and in the [offline download](../publish/download-analytic-reports.md) of the [Reviews report](../publish/reviews-report.md).
