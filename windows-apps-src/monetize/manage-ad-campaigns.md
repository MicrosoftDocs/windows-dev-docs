# Manage ad campaigns

Use these methods in the [Microsoft Store promotions API](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md) to create, edit and get promotional ad campaigns for your app. Each campaign you create using this method can be associated with only one app.

>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also create and manage ad campaigns using Partner Center, and campaigns that you create programmatically can be accessed in Partner Center. For more information about managing ad campaigns in Partner Center, see [Create an ad campaign for your app](../publish/create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md).

When you use these methods to create or update a campaign, you typically also call one or more of the following methods to manage the *delivery lines*, *targeting profiles*, and *creatives* that are associated with the campaign. For more information about the relationship between campaigns, delivery lines, targeting profiles, and creatives, see [Run ad campaigns using Microsoft Store services](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#call-the-windows-store-promotions-api).

* [Manage targeting profiles for ad campaigns](manage-targeting-profiles-for-ad-campaigns.md)
* [Manage creatives for ad campaigns](manage-creatives-for-ad-campaigns.md)

## Prerequisites

To use these methods, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store promotions API.

  >**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the prerequisites, be sure that you [create at least one paid ad campaign in Partner Center](../publish/create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md) and that you add at least one payment instrument for the ad campaign in Partner Center. Delivery lines for ad campaigns you create using this API will automatically bill the default payment instrument chosen on the **Ad campaigns** page in Partner Center.

* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](run-ad-campaigns-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for these methods. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
