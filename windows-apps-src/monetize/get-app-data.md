# Get app data

Use the following methods in the Windows Store submission API to get data for existing apps in your Dev Center account. For an introduction to the Windows Store submission API, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Create and manage submissions using Windows Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

Before you can use these methods, the app must already exist in your Dev Center account. To create or manage submissions for apps, see the methods in [Manage app submissions](manage-app-submissions.md).
