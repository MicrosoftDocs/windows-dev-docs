Use this method in the Windows Store submission API to [halt the rollout](../publish/gradual-package-rollout.md#completing-the-rollout) for a package flight submission. For more information about the process of process of creating a package flight submission by using the Windows Store submission API, see [Manage package flight submissions](manage-flight-submissions.md).

>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;If you halt the rollout for a package flight submission and then [create a new package flight submission](create-a-flight-submission.md), the new submission is a clone of the halted submission.

## Prerequisites
