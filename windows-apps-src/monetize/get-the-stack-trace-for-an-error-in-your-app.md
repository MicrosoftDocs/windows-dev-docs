# Get the stack trace for an error in your app

Use this method in the Microsoft Store analytics API to get the stack trace for an error in your app. This method can only download the stack trace for an app error that occurred in the last 30 days. Stack traces are also available in the **Failures** section of the [Health report](../publish/health-report.md) in Partner Center.

Before you can use this method, you must first use the [get details for an error in your app](get-details-for-an-error-in-your-app.md) method to retrieve the ID of the CAB file that is associated with the error for which you want to retrieve the stack trace.

## Prerequisites


To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store analytics API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* Get the ID of the CAB file that is associated with the error for which you want to retrieve the stack trace. To get this ID, use the [get details for an error in your app](get-details-for-an-error-in-your-app.md) method to retrieve details for a specific error in your app, and use the **cabId** value in the response body of that method.
