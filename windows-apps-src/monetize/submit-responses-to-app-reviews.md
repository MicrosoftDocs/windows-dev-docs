# Submit responses to reviews


Use this method in the Microsoft Store reviews API to programmatically respond to reviews of your app. When you call this method, you must specify the IDs of the reviews you want to respond to. Review IDs are available in the response data of the [get app reviews](get-app-reviews.md) method in the Microsoft Store analytics API and in the [offline download](../publish/download-analytic-reports.md) of the [Reviews report](../publish/reviews-report.md).

When a customer submits a review, they can choose not to receive responses to their review. If you try to respond to a review for which the customer chose not to receive responses, the response body of this method will indicate that the response attempt was unsuccessful. Before calling this method, you can optionally determine whether you are allowed to respond to a given review by using the [get response info for app reviews](get-response-info-for-app-reviews.md) method.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to using this method to programmatically respond to reviews, you can alternatively respond to reviews [using Partner Center](../publish/respond-to-customer-reviews.md).

## Prerequisites

To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](respond-to-reviews-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store reviews API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](respond-to-reviews-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* Get the IDs of the reviews you want to respond to. Review IDs are available in the response data of the [get app reviews](get-app-reviews.md) method in the Microsoft Store analytics API and in the [offline download](../publish/download-analytic-reports.md) of the [Reviews report](../publish/reviews-report.md).
