# Commit a package flight submission




Use this method in the Windows Store submission API to commit a new or updated package flight submission to Windows Dev Center. The commit action alerts Dev Center that the submission data has been uploaded (including any related packages). In response, Dev Center commits the changes to the submission data for ingestion and publishing. After the commit operation succeeds, the changes to the submission are shown in the Dev Center dashboard.

For more information about how the commit operation fits into the process of creating a package flight submission by using the Windows Store submission API, see [Manage package flight submissions](manage-flight-submissions.md).

## Prerequisites

To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Windows Store submission API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* [Create a package flight submission](create-a-flight-submission.md) and then [update the submission](update-a-flight-submission.md) with any necessary changes to the submission data.
