# Create an app submission

Use this method in the Microsoft Store submission API to create a new submission for an app that is registered to your Partner Center account. After you successfully create a new submission by using this method, [update the submission](update-an-app-submission.md) to make any necessary changes to the submission data, and then [commit the submission](commit-an-app-submission.md) for ingestion and publishing.

For more information about how this method fits into the process of creating an app submission by using the Microsoft Store submission API, see [Manage app submissions](manage-app-submissions.md).

After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* Make sure the app already has at least one submission with the [age ratings](../publish/age-ratings.md) information completed.
