# Download the CAB file for an error in your Xbox One game

Use this method in the Microsoft Store analytics API to download the CAB file that is associated with a particular error in your Xbox One game that was ingested through the Xbox Developer Portal (XDP) and available in the XDP Analytics Partner Center dashboard. This method can only download the CAB file for an error that occurred in the last 30 days.

Before you can use this method, you must first use the [get details for an error in your Xbox One game](get-details-for-an-error-in-your-xbox-one-game.md) method to retrieve the ID of the CAB file you want to download.

## Prerequisites


To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store analytics API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* Get the ID of the CAB file you want to download. To get this ID, use the [get details for an error in your Xbox One game](get-details-for-an-error-in-your-xbox-one-game.md) method to retrieve details for a specific error in your app, and use the **cabId** value in the response body of that method.
