# Update a package flight submission


Use this method in the Microsoft Store submission API to update an existing package flight submission. After you successfully update a submission by using this method, you must [commit the submission](commit-a-flight-submission.md) for ingestion and publishing.

For more information about how this method fits into the process of creating a package flight submission by using the Microsoft Store submission API, see [Manage package flight submissions](manage-flight-submissions.md).

## Prerequisites

To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store submission API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
* Create a package flight submission for one of your apps. You can do this in Partner Center, or you can do this by using the [create a package flight submission](create-a-flight-submission.md) method.
