# Get app reviews


Use this method in the Microsoft Store analytics API to get review data in JSON format for a given date range and other optional filters. This information is also available in the [Reviews report](../publish/reviews-report.md) in Partner Center.

After you retrieve reviews, you can use the [get response info for app reviews](get-response-info-for-app-reviews.md) and [submit responses to app reviews](submit-responses-to-app-reviews.md) methods in the Microsoft Store reviews API to programmatically respond to reviews.

## Prerequisites

To use this method, you need to first do the following:

* If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Microsoft Store analytics API.
* [Obtain an Azure AD access token](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token) to use in the request header for this method. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.
