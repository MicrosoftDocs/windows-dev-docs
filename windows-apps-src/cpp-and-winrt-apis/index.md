# C++/WinRT

[C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt) is an entirely standard modern C++17 language projection for Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs, implemented as a header-file-based library, and designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern Windows API. With C++/WinRT, you can author and consume Windows Runtime APIs using any standards-compliant C++17 compiler. The Windows SDK includes C++/WinRT; it was introduced in version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803).

C++/WinRT is for any developer interested in writing beautiful and fast code for Windows. Here's why.

## The case for C++/WinRT

The C++ programming language is used both in the enterprise *and* independent software vendor (ISV) segments for applications where high levels of correctness, quality, and performance are valued. For example: systems programming; resource-constrained embedded and mobile systems; games and graphics; device drivers; and industrial, scientific, and medical applications, to name but some.

From a language point of view, C++ has always been about authoring and consuming abstractions that are both type-rich and lightweight. But the language has changed radically since the raw pointers, raw loops, and painstaking memory allocation and releasing of C++98. Modern C++ (from C++11 onward) is about clear expression of ideas, simplicity, readability, and a much lower likelihood of introducing bugs.

For authoring and consuming Windows Runtime APIs using C++, there is C++/WinRT. This is Microsoft's recommended replacement for the [C++/CX](/cpp/cppcx/visual-c-language-reference-c-cx?branch=live) language projection, and the [Windows Runtime C++ Template Library (WRL)](/cpp/windows/windows-runtime-cpp-template-library-wrl?branch=live).

You use standard C++ data types, algorithms, and keywords when you use C++/WinRT. The projection does have its own custom data types, but in most cases you don't need to learn them because they provide appropriate conversions to and from standard types. That way, you can continue to use the standard C++ language features that you're accustomed to using, and the source code that you already have. C++/WinRT makes it extremely easy to call Windows Runtime APIs in any C++ application, from Win32 to UWP.

C++/WinRT performs better and produces smaller binaries than any other language option for the Windows Runtime. It even outperforms handwritten code using the ABI interfaces directly. That's because the abstractions use modern C++ idioms that the Visual C++ compiler is designed to optimize. This includes magic statics, empty base classes, **strlen** elision, as well as many newer optimizations in the latest version of Visual C++ targeted specifically at improving the performance of C++/WinRT.
