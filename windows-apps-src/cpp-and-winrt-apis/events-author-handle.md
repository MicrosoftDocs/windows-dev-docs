# Events; how to author and handle them in C++/WinRT

This topic demonstrates how to author a Windows Runtime Component containing a runtime class representing a bank account, which raises an event when its balance goes into debit. It also demonstrates a Core App that consumes the bank account runtime class, calls a function to adjust the balance, and handles any events that result.

## Create a Windows Runtime Component (BankAccountWRC)
Begin by creating a new project in Microsoft Visual Studio. Create a **Visual C++ Windows Runtime Component (C++/WinRT)** project, and name it *BankAccountWRC* (for "bank account Windows Runtime Component").

The newly-created project contains a file named `Class.idl`. Rename that file `BankAccountWRC.idl` so that, when you build, your component's Windows Metadata file is named for the component itself. In `BankAccountWRC.idl`, define your interface as in the listing below.

```idl
// BankAccountWRC.idl
namespace BankAccountWRC
{
	runtimeclass BankAccount
	{
		BankAccount();
		event Windows.Foundation.EventHandler<Single> AccountIsInDebit;
		void AdjustBalance(Single value);
	};
}
```

Save the file and build the project. The build won't succeed just yet. But, during the build process, the `midl.exe` tool is run to create your component's Windows Metadata file (which is `\BankAccountWRC\Debug\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC.winmd`). Then, the `cppwinrt.exe` tool is run (with the `-component` option) to generate source code files to support you in authoring your component. These files include stubs to get you started implementing the `BankAccount` runtime class that you declared in your IDL. Those stubs are `\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC\Generated Files\sources\BankAccount.h` and `BankAccount.cpp`.

Copy the stub files `BankAccount.h` and `BankAccount.cpp` from `\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC\Generated Files\sources\` into the project folder, which is `\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC\`. In **Solution Explorer**, make sure **Show All Files** is toggled on. Right-click the stub files that you copied, and click **Include In Project**. Also, right-click `Class.h` and `Class.cpp`, and click **Exclude From Project**.

Now, let's open `BankAccount.h` and `BankAccount.cpp` and implement our runtime class. In `BankAccount.h`, add two private members to the implementation (*not* the factory implementation) of BankAccount.

```cppwinrt
// BankAccount.h
...
namespace winrt::BankAccountWRC::implementation
{
    struct BankAccount : BankAccountT<BankAccount>
    {
        ...

	private:
		event<Windows::Foundation::EventHandler<float>> accountIsInDebitEvent;
		float balance{ 0.f };
	};
}
...
```

In `BankAccount.cpp`, implement the functions like this.

```cppwinrt
// BankAccount.cpp
...
namespace winrt::BankAccountWRC::implementation
{
	event_token BankAccount::AccountIsInDebit(Windows::Foundation::EventHandler<float> const& handler)
	{
		return accountIsInDebitEvent.add(handler);
	}

	void BankAccount::AccountIsInDebit(event_token const& token)
	{
		accountIsInDebitEvent.remove(token);
	}

	void BankAccount::AdjustBalance(float value)
	{
		balance += value;
		if (balance < 0.f) accountIsInDebitEvent(*this, balance);
	}
}
```

The implementation of the **AdjustBalance** function raises the **AccountIsInDebit** event if the balance goes negative.

If any warnings prevent you from building, then set the project property **C/C++** > **General** > **Treat Warnings As Errors** to **No (/WX-)**, and build the project again.

## Create a Core App (BankAccountCoreApp) to test the Windows Runtime Component
Now create a new project (either in your `BankAccountWRC` solution, or in a new one). Create a **Visual C++ Core App (C++/WinRT)** project, and name it *BankAccountCoreApp*.

Add a reference, and browse to `\BankAccountWRC\Debug\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC.winmd`. Click **Add**, and then **OK**. Now build BankAccountCoreApp. If you see an error that the payload file `readme.txt` doesn't exist, then exclude that file from the Windows Runtime Component project, rebuild it, then rebuild BankAccountCoreApp.

During the build process, the `cppwinrt.exe` tool is run to process the referenced `.winmd` file into source code files containing projected types to support you in consuming your component. The header for the projected types for your component's runtime classes&mdash;named `BankAccountWRC.h`&mdash;is generated into the folder `\BankAccountCoreApp\BankAccountCoreApp\Generated Files\winrt\`.

Include that header in `App.cpp`.

```cppwinrt
#include "winrt/BankAccountWRC.h"
```

Also in `App.cpp`, add the following code to instantiate a BankAccount (using the projected type's default constructor), register an event handler, and then cause the account to go into debit.

```cppwinrt
struct App : implements<App, IFrameworkViewSource, IFrameworkView>
{
	BankAccountWRC::BankAccount bankAccount;
	event_token eventToken;
	...
	
	void Initialize(CoreApplicationView const &)
	{
		eventToken = bankAccount.AccountIsInDebit([](const auto &, float balance)
		{
			assert(balance < 0.f);
		});
	}
	...

	void Uninitialize()
	{
		bankAccount.AccountIsInDebit(eventToken);
	}
	...

	void OnPointerPressed(IInspectable const &, PointerEventArgs const & args)
	{
		bankAccount.AdjustBalance(-1.f);
		...
	}
	...
};
```

Each time you click the window, you subtract 1 from the bank account's balance. To demonstrate that the event is being raised as expected, put a breakpoint inside the lambda expression, run the app, and click inside the window.
