# Design basics for UWP apps

![hero image](images/header-design-basics.svg)

The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) design guidance is a resource to help you design and build beautiful, polished apps. It's not a list of prescriptive rules - it's a living document, designed to adapt to our evolving Fluent Design System as well as the needs of our app-building community. 

## Overview

[**Introduction to UWP app design**](design-and-ui-intro.md)

An introduction to UWP features combined with best practices for creating apps that scale beautifully on all types of Windows-powered devices.

[**Fluent Design System**](../fluent-design-system/index.md)

The Fluent Design System presents our goals and principles for creating adaptive, empathetic, and beautiful user interfaces.

## Basics

[**Navigation basics**](navigation-basics.md)

Navigation in UWP apps is based on a flexible model of navigation structures, navigation elements, and system-level features. This article introduces you to these components and shows you how to use them together to create a good navigation experience.

[**Command basics**](commanding-basics.md)

Command elements are the interactive UI elements that enable the user to perform actions, such as sending an email, deleting an item, or submitting a form. This article describes the command elements, such as buttons and check boxes, the interactions they support, and the command surfaces (such as command bars and context menus) for hosting them.

[**Content basics**](content-basics.md)

The main purpose of any app is to provide access to content: in a photo-editing app, the photo is the content; in a travel app, maps and info about travel destinations is the content; and so on. This article provides content design recommendations for the three content scenarios: consumption, creation, and interaction.
