# Pointer click animations



Use pointer animations to provide users with visual feedback when the user taps on an item. The pointer down animation slightly shrinks and tilts the pressed item, and plays when an item is first tapped. The pointer up animation, which restores the item to its original position, is played when the user releases the pointer.

## Do's and don'ts

-   When you use a pointer up animation, immediately trigger the animation when the user releases the pointer. This provides instant feedback to the user that their action has been recognized, even if the action triggered by the tap (such as navigating to a new page) is slower to respond.
