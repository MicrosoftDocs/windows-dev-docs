# Pop-up UI animations



Use pop-up animations to show and hide pop-up UI for flyouts or custom pop-up UI elements. Pop-up elements are containers that appear over the app's content and are dismissed if the user taps or clicks outside of the pop-up element.

## Do's and don'ts


-   Use pop-up animations to show or hide custom pop-up UI elements that aren't a part of the app page itself. The common controls provided by Windows already have these animations built in.
-   Don't use pop-up animations for tooltips or dialogs.
-   Don't use pop-up animations to show or hide UI within the main content of your app; only use pop-up animations to show or hide a pop-up container that displays on top of the main app content.
