# Cortana interactions in UWP apps

Cortana offers a robust and comprehensive extensibility framework that enables you to seamlessly incorporate functionality from your app or service into the Cortana experience.

## We've moved

To get started, see the [Cortana Skills Kit overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/cortana/skills/overview).

To learn how to extend Cortana with functionality from a UWP app using voice commands, see [Cortana voice commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/cortana/voice-commands/vcd).
