# Time picker
 

The time picker gives you a standardized way to let users pick a time value using touch, mouse, or keyboard input.

![Example of time picker](images/time-picker-closed.png)

**Get the Windows UI Library**

|  |  |

| ![WinUI logo](images/winui-logo-64x64.png) | Windows UI Library 2.2 or later includes a new template for this control that uses rounded corners. For more info, see [Corner radius](../style/rounded-corner.md). WinUI is a NuGet package that contains new controls and UI features for Windows apps. For more info, including installation instructions, see [Windows UI Library](/uwp/toolkits/winui/). |

> **Platform APIs**: [TimePicker class](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.TimePicker), [Time property](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.timepicker.time)


## Is this the right control?
Use a time picker to let a user pick a single time value.

For more info about choosing the right control, see the [Date and time controls](date-and-time.md) article.

## Examples

<table>
<th align="left">XAML Controls Gallery<th>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/xaml-controls-gallery-app-icon-sm.png" alt="XAML controls gallery"></img></td>
<td>
    <p>If you have the <strong style="font-weight: semi-bold">XAML Controls Gallery</strong> app installed, click here to <a href="xamlcontrolsgallery:/item/TimePicker">open the app and see the TimePicker in action</a>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVH128X2ZT">Get the XAML Controls Gallery app (Microsoft Store)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery">Get the source code (GitHub)</a></li>
    </ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The entry point displays the chosen time, and when the user selects the entry point, a picker surface expands vertically from the middle for the user to make a selection. The time picker overlays other UI; it doesn't push other UI out of the way.

## Create a time picker

This example shows how to create a simple time picker with a header.

```xaml
<TimePicker x:Name="arrivalTimePicker" Header="Arrival time"/>
```

```csharp
TimePicker arrivalTimePicker = new TimePicker();
arrivalTimePicker.Header = "Arrival time";
```

The resulting time picker looks like this:
