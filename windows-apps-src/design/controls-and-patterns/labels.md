# Labels

 

A label is the name or title of a control or a group of related controls.

> **Important APIs**: Header property, [TextBlock class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209652)

In XAML, many controls have a built-in Header property that you use to display the label. For controls that don't have a Header property, or to label groups of controls, you can use a [TextBlock](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209652) instead.

## Recommendations


-   Use a label to indicate to the user what they should enter into an adjacent control. You can also label a group of related controls, or display instructional text near a group of related controls.
-   When labeling controls, write the label as a noun or a concise noun phrase, not as a sentence, and not as instructional text. Avoid colons or other punctuation.
-   When you do have instructional text in a label, you can be more generous with text-string length and also use punctuation.
