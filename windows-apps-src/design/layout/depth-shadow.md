# Z-depth and shadow

Creating a visual hierarchy of elements in your UI makes the UI easy to scan and conveys what is important to focus on. Elevation, the act of bringing select elements of your UI forward, is often used to achieve such a hierarchy in software. This article discusses how to create elevation in a Windows app by using z-depth and shadow.

Z-depth is a term used amongst 3D app creators to denote the distance between two surfaces along the z-axis. It illustrates how close an object is to the viewer. Think of it as a similar concept to x/y coordinates, but in the z direction.

## Why use z-depth?

In the physical world, we tend to focus on objects that are closer to us. We can apply this spatial instinct to digital UI as well. For example, if you bring an element closer to the user, then the user will instinctively focus on the element. By moving UI elements closer in z-axis, you can establish visual hierarchy between objects, helping users complete tasks naturally and efficiently in your app.

## What is shadow?

Shadow is one way a user perceives elevation. Light above an elevated object creates a shadow on the surface below. The higher the object, the larger and softer the shadow becomes. Elevated objects in your UI donâ€™t need to have shadows, but they help create the appearance of elevation.

In Windows apps, shadows should be used in a purposeful rather than aesthetic manner. Using too many shadows will decrease or eliminate the ability of the shadow to focus the user.

If you use standard controls, ThemeShadow shadows will be incorporated automatically into your UI. However, you can manually include shadows in your UI by using either the ThemeShadow or the DropShadow APIs. 

## ThemeShadow

The [ThemeShadow](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.themeshadow) type can be applied to any XAML element to draw shadows appropriately based on x, y, z coordinates. ThemeShadow also automatically adjusts for other environmental specifications:

- Adapts to changes in lighting, user theme, app environment, and shell.
- Applies shadows to elements automatically based on their z-depth. 
- Keeps elements in sync as they move and change elevation.
- Keeps shadows consistent throughout and across applications.

Here is how ThemeShadow has been implemented on a MenuFlyout. MenuFlyout has a built in experience where the main surface is elevated to 32px and each additional cascading menu is opened +8px above the menu it opens from.

![A screen shot of ThemeShadow applied to a MenuFlyout with three open, nested menus. The first menu is elevated 32px and each subsequent menu that opens from the previous menu is elevated 8px more such that it leaves a distinct shadow on the background.](images/elevation-shadow/themeshadow-menuflyout.png)

### ThemeShadow in common controls

The following common controls will automatically use ThemeShadow to cast shadows from 32px depth unless otherwise specified:

- [Context menu](../controls-and-patterns/menus.md), [Command bar](../controls-and-patterns/app-bars.md), [Command bar flyout](../controls-and-patterns/command-bar-flyout.md), [MenuBar](../controls-and-patterns/menus.md#create-a-menu-bar)
- [Dialogs and flyouts](../controls-and-patterns/dialogs-and-flyouts/index.md) (Dialog at 64px)
- [NavigationView](../controls-and-patterns/navigationview.md)
- [ComboBox](../controls-and-patterns/combo-box.md), [DropDownButton, SplitButton, ToggleSplitButton](../controls-and-patterns/buttons.md)
- [TeachingTip](../controls-and-patterns/dialogs-and-flyouts/teaching-tip.md)
- [AutoSuggestBox](../controls-and-patterns/auto-suggest-box.md) 
- [Calendar/Date/Time pickers](../controls-and-patterns/date-and-time.md)
- [Tooltip](../controls-and-patterns/tooltips.md) (16px)
- [Media transport control](../controls-and-patterns/media-playback.md#media-transport-controls), [InkToolbar](../controls-and-patterns/inking-controls.md)
- [Connected animation](../motion/connected-animation.md)

Note: Flyouts will only apply ThemeShadow when compiled against Windows 10 version 1903 or a more recent SDK.

### ThemeShadow in Popups

It is often the case that your app's UI uses a popup for scenarios where you need user's attention and quick action. These are great examples when shadow should be used to help create hierarchy in your app's UI.

ThemeShadow automatically casts shadows when applied to any XAML element in a [Popup](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.primitives.popup). It will cast shadows on the app background content behind it and any other open Popups below it.

To use ThemeShadow with Popups, use the `Shadow` property to apply a ThemeShadow to a XAML element. Then, elevate the element from other elements behind it, for example by using the z component of the `Translation` property.
For most Popup UI, the recommended default elevation relative to the app background content is 32 effective pixels.

This example shows a Rectangle in a Popup casting a shadow onto the app background content and any other Popups behind it:

```xaml
<Popup>
    <Rectangle x:Name="PopupRectangle" Fill="Lavender" Height="48" Width="96">
        <Rectangle.Shadow>
            <ThemeShadow />
        </Rectangle.Shadow>
    </Rectangle>
</Popup>
```

```csharp
// Elevate the rectangle by 32px
PopupRectangle.Translation += new Vector3(0, 0, 32);
```

### Disabling default ThemeShadow on custom Flyout controls

Controls based on [Flyout](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.flyout), [DatePickerFlyout](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.datepickerflyout), [MenuFlyout](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.menuflyout) or [TimePickerFlyout](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.timepickerflyout) automatically use ThemeShadow to cast a shadow.

If the default shadow doesn't look correct on your control's content then you can disable it by setting the [IsDefaultShadowEnabled](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.flyoutpresenter.isdefaultshadowenabled) property to `false` on the associated FlyoutPresenter:

```xaml
<Flyout>
    <Flyout.FlyoutPresenterStyle>
        <Style TargetType="FlyoutPresenter">
            <Setter Property="IsDefaultShadowEnabled" Value="False" />
        </Style>
    </Flyout.FlyoutPresenterStyle>
</Flyout>
```

### ThemeShadow in other elements

In general we encourage you to think carefully about your use of shadow and limit its use to cases where it introduces meaningful visual hierarchy. However, we do provide a way to cast a shadow from any UI element in case you have advanced scenarios that necessitate it.

To cast a shadow from a XAML element that isn't in a Popup, you must explicitly specify the other elements that can receive the shadow in the `ThemeShadow.Receivers` collection. Receivers cannot be an ancestor of the caster in the visual tree.

This example shows two Rectangles that cast shadows onto a Grid behind them:

```xaml
<Grid>
    <Grid.Resources>
        <ThemeShadow x:Name="SharedShadow" />
    </Grid.Resources>

    <Grid x:Name="BackgroundGrid" Background="{ThemeResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}" />

    <Rectangle x:Name="Rectangle1" Height="100" Width="100" Fill="Turquoise" Shadow="{StaticResource SharedShadow}" />

    <Rectangle x:Name="Rectangle2" Height="100" Width="100" Fill="Turquoise" Shadow="{StaticResource SharedShadow}" />
</Grid>
```

```csharp
/// Add BackgroundGrid as a shadow receiver and elevate the casting buttons above it
SharedShadow.Receivers.Add(BackgroundGrid);

Rectangle1.Translation += new Vector3(0, 0, 16);
Rectangle2.Translation += new Vector3(120, 0, 32);
```

![Two turquoise rectangles next to each other, both with shadows.](images/elevation-shadow/SharedShadow.png)

### Performance best practices for ThemeShadow

1. The system sets a limit of 5 caster-receiver pairs, and will turn off shadow if this is exceeded. Stick to the system-enforced limit of 5 caster-receiver pairs.

2. Limit the number of custom receiver elements to the minimum necessary.

3. If multiple receiver elements are at the same elevation, try to combine them by targeting a single parent element instead.

4. If multiple elements will cast the same type of shadow onto the same receiver elements then add the shadow as a shared resource and reuse it.

## Drop shadow

DropShadow is not automatically responsive to its environment and does not use light sources. For example implementations, see the [DropShadow Class](/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition.dropshadow).

## Which shadow should I use?

| Property | ThemeShadow | DropShadow |
| - | - | - |
| **Min SDK** | Windows 10 version 1903 | 14393 |
| **Adaptability** | Yes | No |
| **Customization** | No | Yes |
| **Light source** | Automatic (global by default, but can override per app) | None |
| **Supported in 3D environments** | Yes | No |

- Keep in mind that the purpose of shadow is to provide meaningful hierarchy, not as a simple visual treatment.
- Generally, we recommend using ThemeShadow, which adapts automatically to its environment.
- For concerns about performance, limit the number of shadows, use other visual treatment, or use DropShadow.
- If you have more advanced scenarios to achieve visual hierarchy, consider using other visual treatment (for example, color). If shadow is needed, then use DropShadow.
