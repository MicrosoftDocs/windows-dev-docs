# Tile content schema

 

The following describes all of the properties and elements within tile content.

If you would rather use raw XML instead of the [Notifications library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Notifications/), please see [the XML schema](../tiles-and-notifications/adaptive-tiles-schema.md).

## TileContent
TileContent is the top level object that describes a tile notification's content, including visuals.

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Visual** | [ToastVisual](#tilevisual) | true | Describes the visual portion of the tile notification. |


## TileVisual
The visual portion of tiles contains the visual specifications for all tile sizes, and more visual-related properties.

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TileSmall** | [TileBinding](#tilebinding) | false | Provide an optional small binding to specify content for the small tile size. |
| **TileMedium** | [TileBinding](#tilebinding) | false | Provide an optional medium binding to specify content for the medium tile size. |
| **TileWide** | [TileBinding](#tilebinding) | false | Provide an optional wide binding to specify content for the wide tile size. |
| **TileLarge** | [TileBinding](#tilebinding) | false | Provide an optional large binding to specify content for the large tile size. |
| **Branding** | [TileBranding](#tilebranding) | false | The form that the tile should use to display the app's brand. By default, inherits branding from the default tile. |
| **DisplayName** | string | false | An optional string to override the tile's display name while showing this notification. |
| **Arguments** | string | false | New in Anniversary Update: App-defined data that is passed back to your app via the TileActivatedInfo property on LaunchActivatedEventArgs when the user launches your app from the Live Tile. This allows you to know which tile notifications your user saw when they tapped your Live Tile. On devices without the Anniversary Update, this will simply be ignored. |
| **LockDetailedStatus1** | string | false | If you specify this, you must also provide a TileWide binding. This is the first line of text that will be displayed on the lock screen if the user has selected your tile as their detailed status app. |
| **LockDetailedStatus2** | string | false | If you specify this, you must also provide a TileWide binding. This is the second line of text that will be displayed on the lock screen if the user has selected your tile as their detailed status app. |
| **LockDetailedStatus3** | string | false | If you specify this, you must also provide a TileWide binding. This is the third line of text that will be displayed on the lock screen if the user has selected your tile as their detailed status app. |
| **BaseUri** | Uri | false | A default base URL that is combined with relative URLs in image source attributes. |
| **AddImageQuery** | bool? | false | Set to "true" to allow Windows to append a query string to the image URL supplied in the toast notification. Use this attribute if your server hosts images and can handle query strings, either by retrieving an image variant based on the query strings or by ignoring the query string and returning the image as specified without the query string. This query string specifies scale, contrast setting, and language; for instance, a value of "www.website.com/images/hello.png" given in the notification becomes "www.website.com/images/hello.png?ms-scale=100&ms-contrast=standard&ms-lang=en-us" |
| **Language**| string | false | The target locale of the visual payload when using localized resources, specified as BCP-47 language tags such as "en-US" or "fr-FR". This locale is overridden by any locale specified in binding or text. If not provided, the system locale will be used instead. |


## TileBinding
The binding object contains the visual content for a specific tile size.

| Property | Type | Required | Description |

One of [TileBindingContentAdaptive](#tilebindingcontentadaptive), [TileBindingContentIconic](#TileBindingContentIconic), [TileBindingContentContact](#TileBindingContentContact), [TileBindingContentPeople](#TileBindingContentPeople), or [TileBindingContentPhotos](#TileBindingContentPhotos). |
| **Branding** | [TileBranding](#tilebranding) | false | The form that the tile should use to display the app's brand. By default, inherits branding from the default tile. |
| **DisplayName** | string | false | An optional string to override the tile's display name for this tile size. |
| **Arguments** | string | false | New in Anniversary Update: App-defined data that is passed back to your app via the TileActivatedInfo property on LaunchActivatedEventArgs when the user launches your app from the Live Tile. This allows you to know which tile notifications your user saw when they tapped your Live Tile. On devices without the Anniversary Update, this will simply be ignored. |
| **BaseUri** | Uri | false | A default base URL that is combined with relative URLs in image source attributes. |
| **AddImageQuery** | bool? | false | Set to "true" to allow Windows to append a query string to the image URL supplied in the toast notification. Use this attribute if your server hosts images and can handle query strings, either by retrieving an image variant based on the query strings or by ignoring the query string and returning the image as specified without the query string. This query string specifies scale, contrast setting, and language; for instance, a value of "www.website.com/images/hello.png" given in the notification becomes "www.website.com/images/hello.png?ms-scale=100&ms-contrast=standard&ms-lang=en-us" |
| **Language**| string | false | The target locale of the visual payload when using localized resources, specified as BCP-47 language tags such as "en-US" or "fr-FR". This locale is overridden by any locale specified in binding or text. If not provided, the system locale will be used instead. |
