# Toast headers

You can visually group a set of related notifications inside Action Center by using a toast header on your notifications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requires Desktop Creators Update and 1.4.0 of Notifications library**: You must be running Desktop build 15063 or higher to see toast headers. You must use version 1.4.0 or higher of the [UWP Community Toolkit Notifications NuGet library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Notifications/) to construct the header in your toast's content. Headers are only supported on Desktop.

As seen below, this group conversation is unified under a single header, "Camping!!". Each individual message in the conversation is a separate toast notification sharing the same toast header.

You can also choose to visually group your notifications by category too, like flight reminders, package tracking, and more.

## Add a header to a toast

Here's how you add a header to a toast notification.

> [!NOTE]
> Headers are only supported on Desktop. Devices that don't support headers will simply ignore the header.

```csharp
ToastContent toastContent = new ToastContent()
{
    Header = new ToastHeader()
    {
        Id = "6289",
        Title = "Camping!!",
        Arguments = "action=openConversation&id=6289",
    },

    Visual = new ToastVisual() { ... }
};
```

```xml
<toast>

    <header
        id="6289"
        title="Camping!!"
        arguments="action=openConversation&amp;id=6289"/>

    <visual>
        ...
    </visual>

</toast>
```

In summary...

1. Add the **Header** to your **ToastContent**
2. Assign the required **Id**, **Title**, and **Arguments** properties
3. Send your notification ([learn more](send-local-toast.md))
4. On another notification, use the same header **Id** to unify them under the header. The **Id** is the only property used to determine whether the notifications should be grouped, meaning the **Title** and **Arguments** can be different. The **Title** and **Arguments** from the most recent notification within a group are used. If that notification gets removed, then the **Title** and **Arguments** falls back to the next most recent notification.


## Handle activation from a header

Headers are clickable by users, so that the user can click the header to find out more from your app.

Therefore, apps can provide **Arguments** on the header, similar to the launch arguments on the toast itself.

Activation is handled identical to [normal toast activation](send-local-toast.md#handling-activation-1), meaning you can retrieve these arguments in the **OnActivated** method of `App.xaml.cs` just like you do when the user clicks the body of your toast or a button on your toast.

```csharp
protected override void OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs e)
{
    // Handle toast activation
    if (e is ToastNotificationActivatedEventArgs)
    {
        // Arguments specified from the header
        string arguments = (e as ToastNotificationActivatedEventArgs).Argument;
    }
}
```


## Additional info

The header visually separates and groups notifications. It doesn't change any other logistics about the maximum number of notifications an app can have (20) and the first-in-first-out behavior of the notifications list.

The order of notifications within headers are as follows... For a given app, the most recent notification from the app (and the entire header group if part of a header) will appear first.

The **Id** can be any string you choose. There are no length or character restrictions on any of the properties in **ToastHeader**. The only constraint is that your entire XML toast content cannot be larger than 5 KB.

Creating headers doesn't change the number of notifications shown inside Action Center before the "See more" button appears (this number is 3 by default and can be configured by the user for each app in system Settings for notifications).

Clicking on the header, just like clicking on the app title, does not clear any notifications belonging to this header (your app should use the toast APIs to clear the relevant notifications).
