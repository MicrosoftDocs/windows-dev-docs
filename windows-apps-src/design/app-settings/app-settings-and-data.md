# App settings and data




This section contains user experience guidelines for presenting app settings and storing those settings as app data.

App settings are the user-customizable portions of your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. For example, a news reader app might let the user specify which news sources to display or how many columns to display on the screen.

App data is data that the app itself creates and manages. It includes runtime state, app settings, reference content (such as the dictionary definitions in a dictionary app), and other settings. App data is tied to the existence of the app and is only meaningful to that app.
