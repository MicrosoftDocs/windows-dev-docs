# How-to guides for Windows 10 apps

\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Here’s the info you need to create a Universal Windows app that can run on any Windows 10-based device, including phones, tablets, and PCs. This section offers both instructions and code examples organized by the kind of task you want to accomplish.

If you'd like an introduction to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and how it lets you use the same code to deliver appropriately tailored experiences to multiple Windows device types, see these articles:

-   Create your first Universal Windows app
-   Guide to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps
-   What's a Universal Windows app?

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [App-to-app communication](app-to-app/index.md) | Learn how Universal Windows apps (including Windows web apps) can launch other apps and exchange data and files. Complex tasks that would normally require a user to manage multiple apps can now be handled seamlessly. |
| [Audio, video, and camera](audio-video-camera/index.md) | Capture photos and videos from a capture device, such as a webcam, and render audio streams in an app. |
| [Contacts and calendar](contacts-and-calendar/index.md) | Let your users access their Windows contacts and calendar appointments from your app, so they can share content, email, and calendar info, or send messages without having to switch between Windows apps.|
| [Data access](data-access/index.md) | Learn about storing data on the device in a private database and using object relational mapping in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. |
| [Data binding](data-binding/index.md) | Synchronize the UI elements of your Universal Windows app with different sources of data, including databases, files, and internal objects, to provide a data-driven user experience. |
| [Debugging, testing, and performance](debug-test-perf/index.md) | Learn about the testing and debugging cycle and how to use the related tools provided with Microsoft Visual Studio or as separate downloads. Make sure your Universal Windows app delivers the experience you intend and is ready for publication to the Windows Store. |
| [Devices, sensors, and power](devices-sensors\index.md) | Integrate different devices like printers, cameras, sensors and peripherals used in retail into your Universal Windows app to provide a robust and flexible connected-device experience for your users. | 
| [Enterprise](enterprise/index.md) | Learn about the key enterprise features for Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. |
| [Files, folders, and libraries](files/index.md) | Learn how to read and write text and other data formats in files, and manage files and folders. Also find info about reading and writing app settings, about file and folder pickers, and about special, "sandboxed" locations such as the Video/Music library. |
| [Games and DirectX](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt228375.aspx) | Understand the basics of creating games on the new Universal Windows Platform (UWP). |
| [Graphics and animation](graphics/index.md) | Enhance your Universal Windows app with UI graphics and animations that keep users visually engaged and interested in the user experience. |
| [Launching, resuming, and background tasks](launch-resume/index.md) | Create background tasks and register for system-generated events to provide functionality even when your Universal Windows app is suspended or not running. |
| [Maps and location](maps-and-location/index.md) | Learn how your Universal Windows app can tap into the Bing Maps service and produce accurate map visuals that now include aerial 3D imagery and street-level views. |
| [Monetize your app](monetize\index.md) | Create free apps, trials (both time-based and feature-based), paid apps, and in-app products, to give your customers the option to try your app for free and make purchase decisions during their experience with your app. |
| [Networking and web services](networking\index.md) | Create a connected, or network-aware, Universal Windows app that can use available network connections to do things like fetch RSS feeds, engage in multiplayer games, or interact with nearby devices. |
| [Packaging apps](packaging\index.md) | Understand the app package that contains the files that constitute your Universal Windows app, and how you work with it to deploy, manage, and update your app through the Windows Store. Also learn about app capabilities, which must be declared in the app package manifest for access to specific resources. |
| [Porting apps to Windows 10](porting\index.md) | Bring an existing app to the UWP where you can create a single app package that not only targets the Windows-based devices of your choosing, but also capitalizes on features and user experiences unique to each device type. |
| [Security](security/index.md) | Manage sensitive user info and help secure app data and resources while keeping the user experience intact. Features like basic password protection, roaming credentials, single sign-on, Microsoft account authentication, and cryptography are all at your disposal. |
| [Threading and async programming](threading-async/index.md) | Use asynchronous programming to help your app stay responsive by allowing it to continue to run and respond to the UI while it completes other work that might take an extended amount of time. |
| [Windows Runtime components](winrt-components/index.md) | Learn more about these self-contained objects that you can initialize and use from any language, including C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, and C++. For example, you could create a Windows Runtime component in C++ that uses a third-party library to perform a computationally expensive operation, or simply reuse some Visual Basic or C# code in your Universal Windows app. 
| [XAML platform](xaml-platform/index.md) | Get started with the basic concepts of the XAML programming language. Or, if you're already familiar with XAML, jump ahead and learn how to implement Windows Runtime features in XAML using Visual Studio to create a great Universal Windows app. |
