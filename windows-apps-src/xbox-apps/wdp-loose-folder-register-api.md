**Notes**

There are at least three different ways to get the loose app on the console in the desired folder. The easiest is to simply copy the files via SMB to \\<IP_Address>\DevelopmentFiles\LooseApps. This will require a username and password on UWA kits which can be obtained via [/ext/smb/developerfolder](wdp-smb-api.md). 

The second way is by copying over individual files to the correct location by doing a POST to /api/filesystem/apps/file where knownfolderid is DevelopmentFiles, packagefullname is empty, and filename and path are properly supplied (path should begin with LooseApps).

The third way is to copy an entire folder at a time via [/api/app/packagemanager/upload](wdp-folder-upload.md) where destinationFolder is the name of the folder to be placed under d:\developmentfiles\looseapps and the payload is a multi-part conforming http body of the directory contents.
