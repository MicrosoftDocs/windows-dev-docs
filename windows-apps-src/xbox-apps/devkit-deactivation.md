If you decide you no longer want to use your console for development, use the following steps to deactivate Developer Mode.

## Switch to Retail Mode

## Deactivate your console using the Dev Mode Activation app

The preferred method of deactivating Developer Mode on your console is to use the **Dev Mode Activation** app. 

1. Navigate to **Games & apps** > **Apps**.

See [Xbox One Developer Mode activation](devkit-activation.md) for more information about the **Dev Mode Activation** app. 

## Reset your console

You can also deactivate Developer Mode by resetting your console.  

> [!NOTE]
> When you reset your console, all local save game data will be lost.

To reset your console perform the following steps:

1.  Go to **My games & apps**.

2.  Select **Apps**, and then select **Settings**.

3.  Go to **System** in the left pane, and then select **Console info** in the right pane.

5.  Next, select **Reset and remove everything**. This option resets the console to its original retail state.  All of your apps, games, and local save data will be deleted. Note that choosing the other option, **Reset and keep my games & apps**, will not remove your console from the developer program.

## Deactivate your console using Partner Center

If you are unable to access your console for any reason, you can also deactivate Developer Mode on your console by using Partner Center.

2. Find the console that you want to deactivate in the list of consoles by matching the serial number, console ID, or the device ID.  

3. Click **Deactivate**.
