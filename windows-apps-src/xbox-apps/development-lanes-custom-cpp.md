# Bring custom C++ games to UWP on Xbox

If you are writing a custom C++ engine, Xbox One has full support for C++. 

C++ games on the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) use DirectX for rendering. Learn more at [DirectX Graphics and Gaming](/windows/desktop/directx).

You can write [C++ with component extensions](/cpp/cppcx/visual-c-language-reference-c-cx) (C++/CX) or [standard C++](/uwp/win32-and-com/win32-and-com-for-uwp-apps) (Win32 and COM).

To learn how to turn your console into a development kit and how to deploy from Visual Studio, see [Games and DirectX](../gaming/index.md) and the [getting started](getting-started.md) guide.

> [!NOTE]
> Xbox One does not support DirectX 12 at this time.
