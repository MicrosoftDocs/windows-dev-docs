# Bring custom C++ games to UWP on Xbox

If you are writing a custom C++ engine, Xbox One has full support for C++. 

C++ games on the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) use DirectX for rendering. Learn more at [DirectX Graphics and Gaming](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee663274(v=vs.85).aspx).

You can write [C++ with component extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh699871.aspx) (C++/CX) or [standard C++](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt592904.aspx) (Win32 and COM).

To learn how to turn your console into a development kit and how to deploy from Visual Studio, see [Games and DirectX](../gaming/index.md) and the [getting started](getting-started.md) guide.

> [!NOTE]
> Xbox One does not support DirectX 12 at this time.
