| [Play audio and video with MediaPlayer](play-audio-and-video-with-mediaplayer.md) | This article shows you how to take advantage of the new features and improvements to the media playback system for UWP apps. Starting with Windows 10, version 1607,the recommended best practice for playing media is to use the [**MediaPlayer**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) class instead of [**MediaElement**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.MediaElement) for media playback. The lightweight XAML control, [**MediaPlayerElement**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.MediaPlayerElement), has been introduced to allow you render media content in a XAML page. **MediaPlayer** provides several advantages including automatic integration with the System Media Transport Controls and a simpler, one-process model for background audio. This article also shows you how to render video to a Windows.UI.Composition surface and how to use a [**MediaTimelineController**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.MediaTimelineController) to synchronize multiple media players.                                                                                                          |
| [Media items, playlists, and tracks](media-playback-with-mediasource.md)                         | This article shows you how to use the [**MediaSource**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Core.MediaSource) class, which provides a common way to reference and play back media from different sources such as local or remote files and exposes a common model for accessing media data, regardless of the underlying media format. The [**MediaPlaybackItem**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlaybackItem) class extends the functionality of **MediaSource**, allowing you to manage and select from multiple audio, video, and metadata tracks contained in a media item. [**MediaPlaybackList**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlaybackList) allows you to create playback lists from one or more media playback items.                                                                                                               |
| [Integrate with the System Media Transport Controls](integrate-with-systemmediatransportcontrols.md)                               | This article shows you how to integrate your app with the System Media Transport Controls (SMTC). Starting with Windows 10, version 1607, every instance of **MediaPlayer** that you create to play media is automatically displayed by the SMTC. This article shows you how to provide the SMTC with metadata about the content you are playing and how to augment or completely override the default behavior of SMTC controls.                                   |
| [System-supported timed metadata cues](system-supported-metadata-cues.md)                               | This article describes how to take advantage of several formats of timed metadata that may be embedded in media files or streams.                                   |
| [Create, schedule, and manage media breaks](create-schedule-and-manage-media-breaks.md)                                                                             | This article shows you how to create, schedule, and manage media breaks to your media playback app. Starting with Windows 10, version 1607, you can use the [**MediaBreakManager**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaBreakManager) class to quickly and easy add media breaks to any [**MediaPlaybackItem**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlaybackItem) that you play with a [**MediaPlayer**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). Media breaks are typically used to insert audio or video ads into media content. Once you schedule one or more media breaks, the system will automatically play your media content at the specified time during playback. The **MediaBreakManager** provides events so that your app can react when media breaks start, end, or when they are skipped by the user. You can also access a [**MediaPlaybackSession**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlaybackSession) for your media breaks to monitor events like download and buffering progress updates.                                                                                                                     |
| [Play media in the background](background-audio.md)                                                                             | This article shows you how to configure your app so that media continues to play when your app moves from the foreground to the background. This means that even after the user has minimized your app, returned to the home screen, or has navigated away from your app in some other way, your app can continue to play audio. With Windows 10, version 1607, a new single-process model for background media playback has been introduced that is much quicker and easier to implement than the legacy two-process model. This article includes information on handling the new application lifecycle events [**EnteredBackground**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.coreapplication.enteredbackground) and [**LeavingBackground**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.coreapplication.leavingbackground) to manage your app's memory usage while running in the background.                                                                                                                    |
| [Adaptive Streaming](adaptive-streaming.md)                                                       | This article describes how to add playback of adaptive streaming multimedia content to a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. This feature currently supports playback of Http Live Streaming (HLS) and Dynamic Streaming over HTTP (DASH) content.                                          |
