| [Camera](camera.md) | Lists the camera features that are available for UWP apps, and links to the how-to articles that show how to use them. |
| [Media playback](media-playback.md) | Provides information about creating UWP apps that use audio and video playback. |
| [Detect faces in images or videos](detect-and-track-faces-in-an-image.md) | Shows you how to use the [FaceTracker](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.FaceAnalysis.FaceTracker) for tracking faces over time in a sequence of video frames. |
| [Media compositions and editing](media-compositions-and-editing.md) | Shows you how to use the APIs in the [**Windows.Media.Editing**](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Editing) namespace to quickly develop apps that enable the users to create media compositions from audio and video source files. |
| [Custom video effects](custom-video-effects.md) | Describes how to create a Windows Runtime component that implements the **IBasicVideoEffect** interface to allow you to create custom effects for video streams. |
| [Custom audio effects](custom-audio-effects.md) | Describes how to create a Windows Runtime component that implements the **IBasicAudioEffect** interface to allow you to create custom effects for audio streams. |
| [Create, edit, and save bitmap images](imaging.md) | Explains how to load and save image files by using the [SoftwareBitmap](/uwp/api/Windows.Graphics.Imaging.SoftwareBitmap) object to represent bitmap images.  |
| [Audio device information properties](audio-device-information-properties.md)  | Lists the device information properties related to audio devices. |
| [Detect and respond to audio state changes](detect-and-respond-to-audio-state-changes.md)  | Explains how UWP apps can detect and respond to system-initiated changes in audio stream levels. |
| [Transcode media files](transcode-media-files.md) | Shows you how to use the [Windows.Media.Transcoding](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Transcoding) APIs to transcode video files from one format to another. |
| [Process media files in the background](process-media-files-in-the-background.md) | Shows you how to use the [MediaProcessingTrigger](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Background.MediaProcessingTrigger) and a background task to process media files in the background. |
| [Audio graphs](audio-graphs.md) | Shows you how to use the APIs in the [Windows.Media.Audio](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Audio) namespace to create audio graphs for audio routing, mixing, and processing scenarios. |
| [MIDI](midi.md) | Shows you how to enumerate MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) devices and send and receive MIDI messages from a UWP app. |
| [Import media from a device](import-media-from-a-device.md) | Describes how to import media from a device, including searching for available media sources, importing files such as videos, photos, and sidecar files, and deleting the imported files from the source device. |
| [Camera-independent Flashlight](camera-independent-flashlight.md) | Shows you how to access and use a device's lamp, if one is present. Lamp functionality is managed separately from the device's camera and camera flash functionality. |
| [Supported codecs](supported-codecs.md) | Lists the audio, video, and image codec and format support for UWP apps. |
| [Query for installed codecs](codec-query.md) | Shows you how to query for audio and video encoders and decoders that are installed on a device. |
| [Screen capture](screen-capture.md) | Describes how to use the [Windows.Graphics.Capture namespace](/uwp/api/windows.graphics.capture) to acquire frames from a display or application window, to create video streams or snapshots to build collaborative and interactive experiences. |
