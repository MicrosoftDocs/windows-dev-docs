They don’t mix metaphors, and they communicate only what’s needed, as speedily and simply as possible.</p>  </div></div></div><div class="side-by-side"><div class="side-by-side-content">  <div class="side-by-side-content-left">   <p><b>[Motion](motion.md)</b><br/>   Purposeful, well-designed animations bring apps to life and make the experience feel crafted and polished.

Its style should never get in the way of that goal. But typography also has an important role as a layout component—with a powerful effect on the density and complexity of the design—and on the user’s experience of that design.</p>   <div class="uwpd-no-bullet-list">   <ul>    <li>[Fonts](fonts.md)</li>    <li>[Segoe MDL2 icons](segoe-ui-symbol-font.md)</li>   </ul>   </div>  </div>      <div class="side-by-side-content-right">   <p><b>[Styling controls](../controls-and-patterns/styling-controls.md)</b><br/>   You can customize the appearance of your apps in many ways by using the XAML framework. Styles let you set control properties and reuse those settings for a consistent appearance across multiple controls.</p>  </div></div></div>
