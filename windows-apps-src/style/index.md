# UWP style guide

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://az835927.vo.msecnd.net/sites/uwp/Resources/css/custom.css"> 

<p>The Fluent Design System helps you create modern, clean UI that incorporates light, depth, motion, material, and scale. The guidelines in this section help you create a Fluent Design through color, typography, and new features such as [acrylic material](../style/acrylic.md) and [Reveal](../style/reveal.md). 
</p>

<p>Design guidance and code examples that teach you how to define your UWP app’s personality through color, typography, and motion.</p>

## UWP and the Fluent Design System


 
 How can you incorporate Fluent Design into your app? We're continually adding new controls and features that make it easy. Here's a list of current Fluent Design features for UWP:  

* [Acrylic](../style/acrylic.md) is a type of brush that creates semi-transparent surfaces.
* [Parallax](../style/parallax.md) adds three-dimensional perspective, depth, and movement to scrolling content, such as lists.
* [Reveal](../style/reveal.md) uses light to create a hover effect that illuminates interactive UI elements. 
* [Connected animations](../style/connected-animation.md) provide graceful scene transitions that improve usability by maintaining context and providing continuity. 

We've also updated our [design guidelines](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design) (which you're current reading) so they're based on Fluent Design principles.

<div style="column-count: 2; column-gap: 40px; margin-top: 40px;">

<div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;"><b>[Acrylic material](acrylic.md)</b><br/>
   Create a sense of depth with acrylic, a brush that creates stunning, translucent surfaces.</p>
</div>

<div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Color](color.md)</b><br/>
   Color provides intuitive wayfinding through an app's various levels of information and serves as a crucial tool for reinforcing the interaction model.</p>
</div>
<div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Icons](icons.md)</b><br/>
   Good icons harmonize with typography and with the rest of the design language. They don’t mix metaphors, and they communicate only what’s needed, as speedily and simply as possible.</p>

</div>
  <div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Motion and animation](motion.md)</b><br/>
   Purposeful, well-designed animations bring apps to life and make the experience feel crafted and polished. Help users understand context changes, and tie experiences together with visual transitions.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Parallax](parallax.md)</b><br/>
   Add three-dimensional perspective and motion to scrolling elements. </p>
  </div>  
  
  <div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Reveal](reveal.md)</b><br/>
   Use light to illuminate important elements. </p>
  </div>    
  
 <div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Sound](sound.md)</b><br/>
   Sound helps complete an application's user experience, and gives them that extra audio edge they need to match the feel of Windows across all platforms.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Typography](typography.md)</b><br/>
   As the visual representation of language, typography’s main task is to be clear. Its style should never get in the way of that goal. But typography also has an important role as a layout component—with a powerful effect on the density and complexity of the design—and on the user’s experience of that design.</p>
  </div>  
  
  <div style="-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid;">
   <p><b>[Styling controls](../controls-and-patterns/styling-controls.md)</b><br/>
   You can customize the appearance of your apps in many ways by using the XAML framework. Styles let you set control properties and reuse those settings for a consistent appearance across multiple controls.</p>
