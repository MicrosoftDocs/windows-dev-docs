For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]**Important APIs**-   [**StorageFolder class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230)-   [**StorageFile class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171)-   [**FileIO class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440)Read and write a file using a [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) object.> **Note**  Also see the [File access sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619995).## Prerequisites-   **Understand async programming for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps**    You can learn how to write asynchronous apps in C# or Visual Basic, see [Call asynchronous APIs in C# or Visual Basic](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187337). To learn how to write asynchronous apps in C++, see [Asynchronous programming in C++](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187334).-   **Know how to get the file that you want to read from, write to, or both**    You can learn how to get a file by using a file picker in [Open files and folders with a picker](quickstart-using-file-and-folder-pickers.md).## Creating a fileHere's how to create a file in the app's local folder. If it already exists, we replace it.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```cs// Create sample file; replace if exists.Windows.Storage.StorageFolder storageFolder =    Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;Windows.Storage.StorageFile sampleFile =    await storageFolder.CreateFileAsync("sample.txt",        Windows.Storage.CreationCollisionOption.ReplaceExisting);``````vb' Create sample file; replace if exists.Dim storageFolder As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolderDim sampleFile As StorageFile = Await storageFolder.CreateFileAsync("sample.txt", CreationCollisionOption.ReplaceExisting)```## Writing to a fileHere's how to write to a writable file on disk using the [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) class. The common first step for each of the ways of writing to a file (unless you're writing to the file immediately after creating it) is to get the file with [**StorageFolder.GetFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227272).> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csWindows.Storage.StorageFolder storageFolder =    Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;Windows.Storage.StorageFile sampleFile =    await storageFolder.GetFileAsync("sample.txt");``````vbDim storageFolder As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolderDim sampleFile As StorageFile = Await storageFolder.GetFileAsync("sample.txt")```**Writing text to a file**Write text to your file by calling the [**WriteTextAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701505) method of the [**FileIO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440) class.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csawait Windows.Storage.FileIO.WriteTextAsync(sampleFile, "Swift as a shadow");``````vbAwait Windows.Storage.FileIO.WriteTextAsync(sampleFile, "Swift as a shadow")```**Writing bytes to a file by using a buffer (2 steps)**1.  First, call [**ConvertStringToBinary**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241385) to get a buffer of the bytes (based on an arbitrary string) that you want to write to your file.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csvar buffer = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.ConvertStringToBinary(        "What fools these mortals be", Windows.Security.Cryptography.BinaryStringEncoding.Utf8);``````vbDim buffer = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.ConvertStringToBinary(                    "What fools these mortals be",                    Windows.Security.Cryptography.BinaryStringEncoding.Utf8)```2.  Then write the bytes from your buffer to your file by calling the [**WriteBufferAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701490) method of the [**FileIO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440) class.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csawait Windows.Storage.FileIO.WriteBufferAsync(sampleFile, buffer);``````vbAwait Windows.Storage.FileIO.WriteBufferAsync(sampleFile, buffer)```**Writing text to a file by using a stream (4 steps)**1.  First, open the file by calling the [**StorageFile.OpenAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn889851) method. It returns a stream of the file's content when the open operation completes.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csvar stream = await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite);``````vbDim stream = Await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite)```2.  Next, get an output stream by calling the [**GetOutputStreamAt**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241738) method from the `stream`. Put this in a **using** statement to manage the output stream's lifetime.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csusing (var outputStream = stream.GetOutputStreamAt(0))    {        // We'll add more code here in the next step.    }    stream.Dispose(); // Or use the stream variable (see previous code snippet) with a using statement as well.``````vbUsing outputStream = stream.GetOutputStreamAt(0)  ' We'll add more code here in the next step.End Using```3.  Now add this code within the existing **using** statement to write to the output stream by creating a new [**DataWriter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208154) object and calling the [**DataWriter.WriteString**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241642) method.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csusing (var dataWriter = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataWriter(outputStream))    {        dataWriter.WriteString("DataWriter has methods to write to various types, such as DataTimeOffset.");    }``````vb    Dim dataWriter As New DataWriter(outputStream)    dataWriter.WriteString("DataWriter has methods to write to various types, such as DataTimeOffset.")```4.  Lastly, add this code (within the inner **using** statement) to save the text to your file with [**StoreAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208171) and close the stream with [**FlushAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241729).> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```cs    await dataWriter.StoreAsync();        await outputStream.FlushAsync();``````vb    Await dataWriter.StoreAsync()        Await outputStream.FlushAsync()```## Reading from a fileHere's how to read from a file on disk using the [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) class. The common first step for each of the ways of reading from a file is to get the file with [**StorageFolder.GetFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227272).> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csWindows.Storage.StorageFolder storageFolder =    Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;Windows.Storage.StorageFile sampleFile =    await storageFolder.GetFileAsync("sample.txt");``````vbDim storageFolder As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolderDim sampleFile As StorageFile = Await storageFolder.GetFileAsync("sample.txt")```**Reading text from a file**Read text from your file by calling the [**ReadTextAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701482) method of the [**FileIO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440) class.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csstring text = await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadTextAsync(sampleFile);``````vbDim text As String = Await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadTextAsync(sampleFile)```**Reading text from a file by using a buffer (2 steps)**1.  First, call the [**ReadBufferAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701468) method of the [**FileIO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440) class.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csvar buffer = await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadBufferAsync(sampleFile);``````vbDim buffer = Await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadBufferAsync(sampleFile)```2.  Then use a [**DataReader**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208119) object to read first the length of the buffer and then its contents.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csusing (var dataReader = Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader.FromBuffer(buffer))    {        string text = dataReader.ReadString(buffer.Length);    }``````vbDim dataReader As DataReader = Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader.FromBuffer(buffer)    Dim text As String = dataReader.ReadString(buffer.Length)```**Reading text from a file by using a stream (4 steps)**1.  Open a stream for your file by calling the [**StorageFile.OpenAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn889851) method. It returns a stream of the file's content when the operation completes.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csvar stream = await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite);``````vbDim stream = Await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite)```2.  Get the size of the stream to use later.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csulong size = stream.Size;``````vbDim size = stream.Size```3.  Get an input stream by calling the [**GetInputStreamAt**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241737) method. Put this in a **using** statement to manage the stream's lifetime. Specify 0 when you call **GetInputStreamAt** to set the position to the beginning of the stream.> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csusing (var inputStream = stream.GetInputStreamAt(0))    {        // We'll add more code here in the next step.    }``````vbUsing inputStream = stream.GetInputStreamAt(0)    ' We'll add more code here in the next step.End Using```4.  Lastly, add this code within the existing **using** statement to get a [**DataReader**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208119) object on the stream then read the text by calling [**DataReader.LoadAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208135) and [**DataReader.ReadString**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208147).> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]```csusing (var dataReader = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader(inputStream))    {        uint numBytesLoaded = await dataReader.LoadAsync((uint)size);        string text = dataReader.ReadString(numBytesLoaded);    }``````vbDim dataReader As New DataReader(inputStream)    Dim numBytesLoaded As UInteger = Await dataReader.LoadAsync(CUInt(size))    Dim text As String = dataReader.ReadString(numBytesLoaded)```
