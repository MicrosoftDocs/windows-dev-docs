# Line strips


A line strip is a primitive that is composed of connected line segments. Your application can use line strips for creating polygons that are not closed. A closed polygon is a polygon whose last vertex is connected to its first vertex by a line segment. If your application makes polygons based on line strips, the vertices are not guaranteed to be coplanar.

The following illustration shows a rendered line strip.

The following code shows how to create vertices for this line strip.

```
struct CUSTOMVERTEX
{
    float x,y,z;
};

CUSTOMVERTEX Vertices[] = 
{
    {-5.0, -5.0, 0.0},
    { 0.0,  5.0, 0.0},
    { 5.0, -5.0, 0.0},
    {10.0,  5.0, 0.0},
    {15.0, -5.0, 0.0},
    {20.0,  5.0, 0.0}
};
```

The code example below shows how to render a line strip in Direct3D.

```
//
// It is assumed that d3dDevice is a valid
// pointer to an IDirect3DDevice interface.
//
d3dDevice->DrawPrimitive( D3DPT_LINESTRIP, 0, 5 );
```
