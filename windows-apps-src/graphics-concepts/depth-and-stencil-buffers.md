# Depth and stencil buffers


A *depth buffer* stores depth information to control which areas of polygons are rendered rather than hidden from view. A *stencil buffer* is used to mask pixels in an image, to produce special effects, including compositing; decaling; dissolves, fades, and swipes; outlines and silhouettes; and two-sided stencil.
