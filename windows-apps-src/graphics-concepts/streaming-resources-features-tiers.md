# Streaming resources features tiers


Direct3D supports streaming resources in three tiers of capabilities.

Tier 1 provides basic capabilities for streaming resources.

Tier 2 adds capabilities beyond Tier 1, such as guaranteeing non-packed texture mipmap when the size is at least one standard tile shape; shader instructions for clamping level-of-detail (LOD) and for obtaining status about the shader operation; also, reading from NULL-mapped tiles treat that sampled value as zero.

Tier 3 adds Texture3D capabilities, beyond Tier 2.

Query functions are available in the versions of Direct3D, to validate hardware and driver support for streaming resources, and at what tier level.
