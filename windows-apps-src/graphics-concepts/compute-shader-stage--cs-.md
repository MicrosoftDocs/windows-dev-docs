# Compute Shader (CS) stage


The Compute Shader (CS) stage provides high-speed general-purpose computing and takes advantage of the large numbers of parallel processors on the graphics processing unit (GPU). The Compute Shader stage provides memory sharing and thread synchronization features to allow more effective parallel programming methods.

A compute shader can run on many threads in parallel.

A compute shader is a [HLSL](/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl)-programmable shader stage that expands Direct3D beyond graphics programming, using the [DirectCompute](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/chuckw/archive/2010/07/14/directcompute.aspx) technology.
