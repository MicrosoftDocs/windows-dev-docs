# Diffuse light maps


Matte surfaces have diffuse light reflection. The brightness of diffuse light depends on the distance from the light source and the angle between the surface normal and the light source direction vector. Texture light maps can simulate complex diffuse lighting.

The diffuse lighting effects simulated by lighting calculations produce only general effects. Your application can simulate more complex diffuse lighting with texture light maps.
