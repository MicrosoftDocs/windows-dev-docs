# Domain Shader (DS) stage


The Domain Shader (DS) stage calculates the vertex position of a subdivided point in the output patch; it calculates the vertex position that corresponds to each domain sample. A domain shader is run once per tessellator stage output point and has read-only access to the hull shader output patch and output patch constants, and the tessellator stage output UV coordinates.

The Domain Shader (DS) stage outputs the vertex position of a subdivided point in the output patch, based on input from the [Hull Shader (HS) stage](hull-shader-stage--hs-.md) and the [Tessellator (TS) stage](tessellator-stage--ts-.md).

## <span id="Input"></span><span id="input"></span><span id="INPUT"></span>Input


-   A domain shader consumes output control points from the [Hull Shader (HS) stage](hull-shader-stage--hs-.md). The hull shader outputs include:
    -   Control points.
    -   Patch constant data.
    -   Tessellation factors. The tessellation factors can include the values used by the fixed-function tessellator as well as the raw values (before rounding by integer tessellation, for example), which facilitates geomorphing, for example.
-   A domain shader is invoked once per output coordinate from the [Tessellator (TS) stage](tessellator-stage--ts-.md).

## <span id="Output"></span><span id="output"></span><span id="OUTPUT"></span>Output


-   The Domain Shader (DS) stage outputs the vertex position of a subdivided point in the output patch.

After the domain shader completes, tessellation is finished and pipeline data continues to the next pipeline stage, such as the [Geometry Shader (GS) stage](geometry-shader-stage--gs-.md) and the [Pixel Shader (PS) stage](pixel-shader-stage--ps-.md). A geometry shader that expects primitives with adjacency (for example, 6 vertices per triangle) is not valid when tessellation is active (this results in undefined behavior, which the debug layer will complain about).

     result.Position = EvaluateSurfaceUV(ControlPoints, myInputUV);
}
