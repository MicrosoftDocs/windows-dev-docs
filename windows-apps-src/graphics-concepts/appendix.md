<td align="left"><p>[Rasterization rules](rasterization-rules.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Rasterization rules define how vector data is mapped into raster data. The raster data is snapped to integer locations that are then culled and clipped (to draw the minimum number of pixels), and per-pixel attributes are interpolated (from per-vertex attributes) before being passed to a pixel shader.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>[Texture block compression](texture-block-compression.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Block Compression (BC) support for textures has been extended in Direct3D 11 to include the BC6H and BC7 algorithms. BC6H supports high-dynamic range color source data, and BC7 provides better-than-average quality compression with less artifacts for standard RGB source data.</p></td>
