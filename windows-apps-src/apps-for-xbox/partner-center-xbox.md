# Setting up your Partner Center account 

Creating a partner center account is the first step in bringing your app to Xbox. Please consider the items below before getting started:

Do you or your company have an existing Partner Center account? If so, there is no need to create a new account; you can add new projects to the existing account.

Be sure to select the right type of Partner Center account which is “Business Developer Account”.

To simplify the verification process, use an email with a corporate domain.

To go through the account set-up, please use the following process:
