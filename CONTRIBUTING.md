# Contributing to UWP Conceptual Documentation

Thank you for your interest in the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) documentation! We appreciate your feedback, edits, and additions to our docs.

## Writing content

Our documentation is written in Markdown, a lightweight text style syntax. If you're not familiar with Markdown, you can [learn the basics on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). When unsure, you can always copy the formatting style from other pages in our docs.

## Public contributions

If you are **not** a Microsoft employee, you can contribute through the [public content repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp). Public contributions are appropriate for changes and clarifications to existing pages.

### Editing a file

If you're already in the public content repository, start by navigating to the file you want to change. From there, select the pencil icon above the displayed content to begin editing.

Alternately, if you're viewing a page in [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com), you can select the **Edit** button on the upper-right portion of the page. This will redirect you to the associated source file in the repository.

When you begin editing, GitHub automatically forks the official repo into your personal GitHub account, where you can make your changes. When you're done, submit a pull request back to the **docs** branch.

### Pull requests

After you submit your pull request, it is evaluated against a content quality checklist to ensure it meets our basic standards. If it passes, it is assigned to a member of the UWP documentation team for further review. If it fails, you'll be told what changes to make.

The assigned reviewer(s) may approve or reject the PR, or work with you to make further changes.

## Internal contributions

If you are a Microsoft employee, you can contribute through the [private content repository](https://github.com/microsoftdocs/windows-uwp-pr). You can find guidance on using this repo in the [Windows Authoring Guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/windows-authoring-guide/uwp/?branch=master). Documentation on upcoming features must be contributed via the private repository only.

### Editing a file

As in the public repository, you can make small changes to the private repository in your browser, without needing to create a local clone. You **must** ensure that you are contributing on the correct branch. For more information about creating your personal branch, see [the instructions in the Windows Authoring Guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/windows-authoring-guide/uwp/conceptual/branches?branch=master).

### Making substantial changes

To make more extensive changes to an existing article, add or change images, or contribute a new article, create a local clone of the private content repo. Fore more information, follow [the instructions in the Windows Authoring Guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/windows-authoring-guide/uwp/conceptual/).

### Pull requests

When creating a pull request in the internal repo, make sure you're merging your personal branch into the branch it was created from.

After you submit your pull request, it is evaluated with [PR Merger](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/prmerger-overview?branch=master) to ensure it meets our basic standards. If it passes, you can comment `#sign-off` to pass it to member of the UWP documentation team for further review. If it fails, you'll be told what changes to make before you can sign off.

The assigned reviewer(s) may approve or reject the PR, or work with you to make further changes. Reviewers will not merge the PR until you have approved it yourself.

## Using issues to provide feedback on UWP Conceptual documentation

If you want to provide feedback on the docs instead of making edits yourself, you can [create an issue in the public repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp/issues). Select the **Issues** tab and select the **New issue** button. Be sure to include the topic title and the URL for the page. Your issue will be assigned to members of the UWP documentation team for review.

* For internal issues, use the [WDG Content Request Tool](http://sesuw2-iis02a/WSCPubRequest/WindowsContentRequestTool.aspx).
