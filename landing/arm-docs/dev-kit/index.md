## Device set up

When the device is turned on and connects to the Internet for the first time, follow the getting started prompts and configuration for Windows Update to ensure the latest software is running on the device.

### Identify buttons and external ports

With the device flat on the table, the 3 buttons on the left side of the device, from left to right, are:

- **Boot to USB button**: Hold the Power button + the Boot to USB button to boot to the USB-C thumb drive. This method can be used to re-image the device with the latest [Recovery Image](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface-recovery-image).
- **UEFI button**: Hold the Power button + the UEFI button to boot into the UEFI menu. *(USB-C monitor connections are not compatible when exploring UEFI.)*
- **Power button**

All external ports will be available after the device boots into Windows 11 including:

- RJ45 for ethernet
- 3 x USB-A ports
- 2 x USB-C ports
- Bluetooth & WiFi

The device supports up to three displays by using the mDP port and the two USB-C ports.

> [!NOTE]
> Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) replaces the standard basic input/output system (BIOS) with new features including faster startup and improved security. You can use UEFI to manage the firmware features on your device.

### Set up power

The dev kit includes a 90W power supply. Attach the power supply to the back on the far left of the device.

- The device will default into "Connected Standby Mode" when not in use. You can choose to [hibernate the device](/windows-hardware/customize/power-settings/adaptive-hibernate) using OS controls.
- Fan control is supported and controlled by firmware. The Fan will come on as needed to manage thermal load.
- There is no battery on the device, hence the system will only run on AC. There is no DC mode to test against.

### Set up display - How to connect monitors

For the best experience, we recommend you use the **mDP port** as your main display for setting up this device.  Until the device is booted into Windows, all display output defaults to the monitor connected to the mDP port.

Scenarios that will require you to use the mDP port include:

- Seeing the startup logo when turning on the device.
- Booting into the UEFI to change firmware settings.
- Installing the recovery image for the device, downloaded from the [Recovery Image page](https://support.microsoft.com/surface-recovery-image).
- BitLocker processes (such as a recovery key prompt or a pre-boot PIN).
- Any Windows OS boot (startup) activity that requires seeing something on the screen before Windows loads, like a Windows startup error or a bug-check boot loop.
- Windows Automatic Recovery.
- Booting into Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) or Windows PE (WinPE) using a USB boot disk.
- Taking ownership of firmware using SEMM.

Requirements and notes for using Windows Developer Kit device display ports:

- If the only display connected to the device is USB-C, if you don’t use the mDP port (as noted above), you won't see a startup screen output when you turn on the device until Windows is booted. The Windows boot process should take ~25 seconds.
- If connecting an HDMI or a DVI monitor to the mDP port, an active **mini-DP to HDMI** or active **mini-DP to DVI adapter** is required. *If the connection is not working, you may be using a passive adapter or a cable with a passive adapter built in. Cables should be 2m/6ft or less.
- When connecting an external keyboard or mouse, use the USB-A ports, not USB-C. Using USB-C to connect a keyboard or mouse will only work intermittently.
