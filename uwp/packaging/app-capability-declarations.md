# App capability declarations

## Which kinds of apps do app capabilities apply to?

*Most* scenarios for app capabilities are relevant only to apps that have package identity, and that run in an AppContainer. All UWP apps meet those criteria; so capabilities apply to them. But you can also give a desktop app package identity, and configure it as an AppContainer app. So capabilities apply to some desktop apps, too.

* For more info about packaging and *package identity*, see [Deployment overview](/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/).
* For more info about AppContainer apps, see [AppContainer for legacy apps](/windows/win32/secauthz/appcontainer-for-legacy-applications-).

A desktop app that's an AppContainer app can be identified by `uap10:TrustLevel="appContainer"` in its app package manifest (for more info, see [Application (Windows 10)](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-application)). Similarly, a desktop app with *mediumIL* (an integrity level of medium) has `uap10:TrustLevel="mediumIL"`. Medium IL apps&mdash;which are also known as *full trust apps*&mdash;don't run in an AppContainer.

The **internetClient** and **enterpriseAuthentication** capabilities grant an application the ability to perform certain operations that the user can already do. So those are examples of capabilities that apply only to AppContainer apps. Conversely, a Medium IL app is already running as the user; so an app like that can already perform those operations without requiring those capabilities.

But there are some scenarios where a Medium IL app should declare a capability, too. In fact, a Medium IL app *needs* to declare the **runFullTrust** restricted capability. And, to be able to register out-of-process COM servers for inter-process communication (IPC), a packaged app needs **runFullTrust**. That feature is known as *Packaged COM* (for more info, see the blog post [COM Server and OLE Document support for the Desktop Bridge](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2017/04/13/com-server-ole-document-support-desktop-bridge/)). 

For info about another scenario that applies even to Medium IL apps, see [Privacy-sensitive capabilities](#privacy-sensitive-capabilities) in this topic.

You can determine whether your app package manifest needs **runFullTrust** simply by building your package. `Makeappx.exe` will validate the schema, and if **runFullTrust** isn't declared but something needs it, then you'll see a detailed error message including what the problem is, together with line and column numbers.

## Declaring capabilities

If you want to access certain APIs or resources (such as pictures or music), or devices (such as the camera or the microphone), then you must declare the appropriate app capabilities in your Windows app's [package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/appx-package-manifest) 

You can declare general capabilities by using the [Manifest Designer](/windows/msix/package/packaging-uwp-apps#configure-your-project) in Visual Studio; or you can add them manually. For more info, see [How to specify capabilities in a package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/how-to-specify-capabilities-in-a-package-manifest). It's important to know that when customers get your app from the Microsoft Store, they're notified of all the capabilities that the app declares. So be sure to declare only the capabilities that your app needs.

## Privacy-sensitive capabilities

A *sensitive resource* is a resource that can access the user's personal data, or cost the user money. In this topic, capabilities that provide apps with access to a *sensitive resource* are annotated by an asterisk (\*) in the **Capability scenario** column.

Privacy-sensitive capabilities signal to the operating system (OS)&mdash;and to the user&mdash;what the app intends to do. Since it's good to send this signal to the users of your app, we recommend that you declare privacy-sensitive capabilities *even for Medium IL apps* (where the application identity is used to provide individual privacy toggles). Doing so allows those apps to be managed in the privacy settings pages (managed by the Windows **Settings** app) as soon as they're installed; as opposed to later, when they access privacy-sensitive resources.

Those privacy settings let the user dynamically control access to sensitive resources. Thus, it's important that your app doesn't assume that a sensitive resource is always available. For more info about accessing sensitive resources, see [Security](../security/index.md). 

## Different kinds of capabilities

There are several kinds of capabilities.

- [General-use capabilities](#general-use-capabilities), which apply to most common app scenarios.
- [Device capabilities](#device-capabilities), which allow your app to access internal and peripheral devices.
- [Restricted capabilities](#restricted-capabilities), which require approval for Microsoft Store submission and/or are generally only available to Microsoft and certain partners.
- [Custom capabilities](#custom-capabilities).

## General-use capabilities

General-use capabilities are specified by using **Capability** elements in your app package manifest. These capabilities apply to the most common app scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> All **Capability** elements must come before any [CustomCapability](#custom-capabilities) and [DeviceCapability](#device-capabilities) elements under the **Capabilities** node in the package manifest.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Music**\* | The **musicLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Music library, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in jukebox apps that make use of the entire Music library.<br/><br/>The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **musicLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the **file picker**.<br/><br/> The **musicLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below. <br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="musicLibrary"/></Capabilities>```
| **Pictures**\* | The **picturesLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Pictures library, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in photo apps that make use of the entire Pictures library.<br/><br/>The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **picturesLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized them by using the **file picker**.<br/><br/>The **picturesLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="picturesLibrary"/></Capabilities>```
| **Videos**\* | The **videosLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Videos, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in movie-playback apps that make use of the entire Videos library.<br/><br/>The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **videosLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the **file picker**.<br/><br/>The **videosLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="videosLibrary"/></Capabilities>```
| **Removable Storage** | The **removableStorage** capability provides programmatic access to files on removable storage, like USB keys and external hard drives, filtered to the file-type associations declared in the package manifest. For example, if a document-reader app declares a .doc file-type association, it can open .doc files on the removable storage device, but not other types of files. Be careful when you declare this capability, because users may include a variety of info in their removable storage devices, and will expect your app to provide a valid justification for programmatic access to the removable storage for all files of the declared type.<br/><br/>Users will expect your app to handle any file associations that you declare. So don't declare file associations that your app cannot handle responsibly. The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app.<br/><br/>Declare the **removableStorage** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker).<br/><br/>The **removableStorage** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="removableStorage"/></Capabilities>```
| **Internet and public networks**\* | There are two capabilities that provide different levels of access to the Internet and public networks.<br/><br/>The **internetClient** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Cannot act as a server. No local network access.<br/>The **internetClientServer** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Can act as a server. No local network access.<br/><br/>Most apps that have a web service component will use **internetClient**. Apps that enable peer-to-peer (P2P) scenarios where the app needs to listen for incoming network connections should use **internetClientServer**. The **internetClientServer** capability includes the access that the **internetClient** capability provides, so you don't need to specify **internetClient** when you specify **internetClientServer**.
| **Homes and work networks**\* | The **privateNetworkClientServer** capability provides inbound and outbound access to home and work networks through the firewall. This capability is typically used for games that communicate across the local area network (LAN), and for apps that share data across a variety of local devices. If your app specifies **musicLibrary**, **picturesLibrary**, or **videosLibrary**, you don't need to use this capability to access the corresponding library in a Home Group. On Windows, this capability does not provide access to the Internet.
| **Appointments** | The **appointments** capability provides access to the user's appointment store. This capability allows read access to appointments obtained from the synced network accounts and to other apps that write to the appointment store. With this capability, your app can create new calendars and write appointments to calendars that it creates.<br/><br/>The **appointments** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="appointments"/></Capabilities>```
| **Contacts**\* | The **contacts** capability provides access to the aggregated view of the contacts from various contacts stores. This capability gives the app limited access (network permitting rules apply) to contacts that were synced from various networks and the local contact store.<br/><br/>The **contacts** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="contacts"/></Capabilities>```
| **Code generation** | The **codeGeneration** capability allows apps to access the following functions which provide JIT capabilities to apps.<br/><br/>[**VirtualProtectFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotectfromapp)<br/>[**CreateFileMappingFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-createfilemappingfromapp)<br/>[**OpenFileMappingFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-openfilemappingfromapp)<br/>[**MapViewOfFileFromApp**](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-mapviewoffilefromapp)
| **AllJoyn** | The **allJoyn** capability allows AllJoyn-enabled apps and devices on a network to discover and interact with each other.<br/><br/>All apps that access APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.AllJoyn**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.AllJoyn) namespace must use this capability.
| **Phone calls** | The **phoneCall** capability allows apps to access all of the phone lines on the device and perform the following functions.<ul><li>Place a call on the phone line and show the system dialer without prompting the user.</li><li>Access line-related metadata.</li><li>Access line-related triggers.</li><li>Allows the user-selected spam filter app to set and check block list and call origin information.</li></ul>The **phoneCall** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="phoneCall"/></Capabilities>```<br/><br/>The <b>phoneCallHistoryPublic</b> capability allows apps to read cellular and some VoIP call history information on the device. This capability also allows the app to write VoIP call history entries. This capability is required to access all members of the <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.PhoneCallHistoryStore"><b>PhoneCallHistoryStore</b></a> class.
| **Recorded Calls Folder**\* | The **recordedCallsFolder** device capability allows apps to access the recorded calls folder.<br/><br/>The **recordedCallsFolder** capability must include the **mobile** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><mobile:Capability Name="recordedCallsFolder"/></Capabilities>```
| **User Account Information**\* | The **userAccountInformation** capability gives apps the ability to access the user's name and picture.<br/><br/>This capability is required to access some APIs in the [**Windows.System.UserProfile**](/uwp/api/Windows.System.UserProfile) namespace.<br/><br/>The **userAccountInformation** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="userAccountInformation"/></Capabilities>```

| **3D Objects** | The **objects3D** capability allows apps to have programmatic access to the 3D object files. This capability is typically used in 3D apps and games that need access to the entire 3D objects library.<br/><br/>This capability is required to access the folder that contains the 3D objects using APIs in the [**Windows.Storage**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage) namespace.<br/><br/>The **objects3D** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="objects3D"/></Capabilities>```
| **Chat Message Access**\* | The **chat** capability allows apps to read and delete SMS and MMS messages. It also allows apps to store messages in the system data store.<br/><br/>This capability is required to access messages using APIs in the [**Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat**](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat) namespace.<br/><br/>The **chat** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="chat"/></Capabilities>```
| **Read Blocked Messages**\* | The **blockedChatMessages** capability allows apps to read SMS and MMS messages that have been blocked by the Spam Filter app.<br/><br/>This capability is required to access the blocked messages using APIs in the [**Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat**](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat) namespace.<br/><br/>The **blockedChatMessages** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="blockedChatMessages"/></Capabilities>```
| **Custom Devices** | The **lowLevelDevices** capability allows apps to access custom devices when a number of additional requirements are met. This capability should not be confused with the **lowLevel** device capability, which allows access to GPIO, I2C, SPI, and PWM devices.<br/><br/> If you develop a custom driver that exposes a [device interface](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/device-interface-classes) and you wish to open a handle to this device and send IOCTLs, you must: <ul><li>Enable the **lowLevelDevices** capability in your application manifest: ```<Capabilities><iot:Capability Name="lowLevelDevices"/></Capabilities>```</li><li>Enable [embedded mode](/windows/iot-core/develop-your-app/EmbeddedMode)</li><li>Mark the device interface as [restricted](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/devpkey-deviceinterface-restricted), either in your [INF](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/deviceaccess/register-the-device-interface-class-as-privileged) or by calling [WdfDeviceAssignInterfaceProperty()](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceassigninterfaceproperty)  in your driver.</ul>You can then use [**Windows.Devices.Custom.CustomDevice**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Custom.CustomDevice) to open a handle to your device. For more information, see [UWP device apps for internal devices](/windows-hardware/drivers/devapps/uwp-device-apps-for-specialized-devices).
| **IoT System Administration** | The **systemManagement** capability allows apps to have basic system administration privileges such as shutting down or rebooting, locale, and timezone.<br/><br/>This capability is required to access some of the APIs in the [**Windows.System**](/uwp/api/Windows.System) namespace.<br/><br/>The **systemManagement** capability must include the **iot** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><iot:Capability Name="systemManagement"/></Capabilities>```
| **Background Media Playback** | The **backgroundMediaPlayback** capability changes the behavior of the media-specific APIs like the [**MediaPlayer**](/uwp/api/windows.media.playback.mediaplayer) and [**AudioGraph**](/uwp/api/windows.media.audio.audiograph) classes to enable media playback while your app is in the background. All active audio streams will no longer mute, but will continue to be audible when an app transitions to the background. Additionally, app lifetime will be extended automatically while playback is occurring.
| **Remote System** | The **remoteSystem** capability allows apps to have access to a list of devices associated with the user's Microsoft Account. Access to the device list is necessary to perform any operations that persist across devices. This capability is required to access to all members of the following.<ul><li>[Windows.System.RemoteSystems](/uwp/api/windows.system.remotesystems) namespace</li><li>[Windows.System.RemoteLauncher](/uwp/api/Windows.System.RemoteLauncher) class</li><li>[AppServiceConnection.OpenRemoteAsync](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.appservice.appserviceconnection.openremoteasync) method</li></ul> |
| **Spatial Perception** | The **spatialPerception** capability provides programmatic access to spatial mapping data, giving mixed reality apps information about surfaces in application-specified regions of space near the user.

| **Borderless Graphics Capture** | The **graphicsCaptureWithoutBorder** capability allows apps to take screenshots without showing a screenshot border around the window or display. This capability is required to use the [Windows.Graphics.Capture.GraphicsCaptureSession.IsBorderRequired](/uwp/api/windows.graphics.capture.graphicscapturesession.isborderrequired) property. This capability is defined in the **uap11:Capability** element.  |
| **Programmatic Graphics Capture** | The **graphicsCaptureProgrammatic** capability allows apps to take screenshots of various windows or displays on its own. This capability is required to create a [Windows.Graphics.Capture.GraphicsCaptureItem](/uwp/api/windows.graphics.capture.graphicscaptureitem) object from a [WindowId](/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowid) or [DisplayId](/uwp/api/windows.graphics.displayid). This capability is defined in the **uap11:Capability** element.  |

## Device capabilities

Device capabilities allow your app to access peripheral and internal devices. Device capabilities are specified by using **DeviceCapability** elements in your app package manifest. This element may require additional child elements and some device capabilities need to be added to the package manifest manually. For more info, see [How to specify device capabilities in a package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/how-to-specify-device-capabilities-in-a-package-manifest) and [**DeviceCapability Schema reference**](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-devicecapability).

> [!NOTE]
> You can have multiple **DeviceCapability** elements under the **Capabilities** element in the package manifest. All **DeviceCapability** elements must come after any **Capability** and [CustomCapability](#custom-capabilities) elements.

<span id="special-and-restricted-capabilities"></span>

## Restricted capabilities

If your app declares any restricted capabilities, then you must provide info during the [app submission process](/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/create-app-submission) in order to be approved to publish your app to the Microsoft Store. You provide this info on the [Submission options](/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/manage-submission-options) page of your submission, explaining how your app uses each restricted capability that it declares.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restricted capabilities are intended for very specific scenarios. The use of these capabilities is highly restricted and subject to additional Store onboarding policy and review. Note that you can sideload apps that declare restricted capabilities without needing to receive any approval. Approval is only required when submitting these apps to the Store.

Be sure not to declare these restricted capabilities unless your app truly needs them. There are cases where such capabilities are necessary and appropriate, such as banking with two-factor authentication, where users provide a smart card with a digital certificate that confirms their identity. Other apps may be designed primarily for enterprise customers and may need access to corporate resources that can't be accessed without the user's domain credentials.

To declare a restricted capability, modify your [app package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/appx-package-manifest) source file (`Package.appxmanifest`). Add the **xmlns:rescap** XML namespace declaration, and use the **rescap** prefix when you declare your restricted capability. For example, here's how to declare the **appCaptureSettings** capability.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Package
    ...
    xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities"
    IgnorableNamespaces="... rescap">
...
<Capabilities>
    <rescap:Capability Name="appCaptureSettings"/>
</Capabilities>
</Package>
```

> [!NOTE]
> All restricted capability elements must come before any [CustomCapability](#custom-capabilities) and [DeviceCapability](#device-capabilities) elements under the **Capabilities** node in the package manifest.

### Restricted capability approval process

Previously, we required you to contact support to get approval to use a capability. We now allow you to provide this info in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) as part of the [submission process](/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/create-app-submission).

When you upload packages for your submission, we will detect whether any restricted capabilities are declared. If we do so, you will be required to provide details about how your product uses each capability on the [Submission options](/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/manage-submission-options#restricted-capabilities) page. Be sure to provide as much detail as possible to help us understand why your product needs to declare the capability. Note that this may add some additional time for your submission to complete the certification process.

During the certification process, our testers will review the info you provide to determine whether your submission is approved to use the capability. Note that this may add some additional time for your submission to complete the certification process. If we approve your use of the capability, your app will continue through the rest of the certification process. You generally will not have to repeat the capability approval process when you submit updates to your app (unless you declare additional capabilities).

If we don't approve your use of the capability, your submission will fail certification, and we will provide feedback in the certification report. You then have the option to create a new submission and upload packages which don't declare the capability, or, if applicable, address any issues related to your use of the capability and request approval in a new submission.

> [!NOTE]
> If your submission uses a development sandbox in Partner Center (for example, this is the case for any game that integrates with Xbox Live), you must request approval in advance rather than providing info on the **Submission options** page. To do so, visit the [Windows Developer support page](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/support). Select Developer support topic **Dashboard issue**, Issue Type **App submissions**, and Subcategory **Other**. Then describe how you are using the capability and why it is necessary for your product. If you do not provide all the information necessary, your request will be denied. You may also be asked to provide more information. Note that this process typically takes 5 business days or longer, so please submit your request well in advance.
>
> You may also use this method of requesting approval (rather than providing this info during your submission), whether or not you're using a development sandbox, if you prefer to confirm that you are approved to use a restricted capability before you start your submission.

The following table lists the restricted capabilities. You may request approval for these capabilities in apps that you submit to the Store by following the process described above.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of these restricted capabilities are almost never approved for apps submitted to the Store, except in very specific and limited circumstances. These capabilities are called out in the table below. We recommend not declaring these capabilities in your app if you plan to distribute it through the Store.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Enterprise** | Windows domain credentials enable a user to log into remote resources using their credentials, and act as if a user provided their user name and password. The **enterpriseAuthentication** capability is typically used in line-of-business apps that connect to servers within an enterprise. <br/><br/>You don't need this capability for generic communication across the Internet.<br/><br/>The **enterpriseAuthentication** capability is intended to support common line-of-business apps. Don't declare it in apps that don't need to access corporate resources. The [**file picker**](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) provides a robust UI mechanism that enables users to open files on a network share for use with an app. Declare the **enterpriseAuthentication** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access, and you cannot realize them by using the **file picker**.<br/><br/>The **enterpriseAuthentication** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="enterpriseAuthentication"/></Capabilities>```<br/><br/>The **enterpriseDataPolicy** capability allows apps to handle enterprise data separately and safely when the app is managed with Windows Information Protection policy (For example: Mobile Device Management and Mobile Application Management systems).  Declare this restricted capability as shown below. <br/><br/>```<Capabilities><rescap:Capability Name="enterpriseDataPolicy"/></Capabilities>```<br/><br/>This capability is required to use all members of the following classes.<ul><li><a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Security.EnterpriseData.FileProtectionManager">FileProtectionManager</a></li><li><a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Security.EnterpriseData.DataProtectionManager">DataProtectionManager</a></li><li><a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Security.EnterpriseData.ProtectionPolicyManager">ProtectionPolicyManager</a></li></ul> |
| **Shared user certificates** | The **sharedUserCertificates** capability enables an app to add and access software and hardware-based certificates in the Shared User store, such as certificates stored on a smart card. This capability is typically used for financial or enterprise apps that require a smart card for authentication.<br/><br/>The **sharedUserCertificates** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="sharedUserCertificates"/></Capabilities>``` |
|**Documents**\* | The **documentsLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Documents library, filtered to the file type associations declared in the package manifest. For example, if a word processing app declared a .doc file type association, it can open .doc files in the user's Documents library. <br/><br/>The **documentsLibrary** capability is *only* needed if your application programmatically accesses the Documents library *without* user intervention. Your application <b>does not</b> need the **documentsLibrary** capability to access the Documents library if the user chooses it with a picker API. Generally, apps should allow the user to choose the location of their files, using one of the following picker APIs: <ul><li>[FileOpenPicker](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) to open an existing file.</li><li>[FileSavePicker](/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.filesavepicker) to save a new file.</li><li>[FolderPicker](/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.folderpicker) to choose a folder to open / save additional files from.</li></ul>Using these APIs allows the user to choose a location that works best for them, such as a cloud-synced account (eg, OneDrive). After the user has picked a file or folder using these APIs, your app can get ongoing access to the location by using the [FutureAccessList](/uwp/api/windows.storage.accesscache.storageapplicationpermissions.futureaccesslist) API. This API allows your app to access the files or folders in the future without asking the user to pick them again.<br/><br/>In cases where existing workflows assume files will be in the Documents library (for example, interop with an existing desktop application) or where you do not want the user to have to choose the location, you can declare the **documentsLibrary** capability for your application. If you use the **documentsLibrary** capability for your application, it is recommended that you also allow the user to pick locations manually.<br/><br/>The **documentsLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.<br/><br/>```<Capabilities><uap:Capability Name="documentsLibrary"/></Capabilities>``` |

| **Broad Filesystem Access** | The **broadFileSystemAccess** capability allows apps to get the same access to the file system as the user who is currently running the app without any additional file-picker style prompts during runtime. It is important to note that this capability is not required to access files that the user has already chosen using the FilePicker or FolderPicker.<br/><br/>This capability works for the [Windows.Storage](/uwp/api/windows.storage) APIs. Because users can grant or deny the permission any time in Settings, you should ensure that your app is resilient to those changes. In the April 2018 update, the default for the permission is On. In the October 2018 update, the default is Off. It is also important that you do not declare any special folder capabilities such as **Documents**, **Pictures**, or **Videos** with this capability. You can enable this capability in your app by adding **broadFileSystemAccess** to your manifest. For an example, see the [File access permissions](../files/file-access-permissions.md) article.<br/><br/>In most cases, to get access to file system locations, your app can use the [**FileOpenPicker**](/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.fileopenpicker), [**FileSavePicker**](/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.filesavepicker), [**FolderPicker**](/uwp/api/windows.storage.pickers.folderpicker), and [**FutureAccessList**](/uwp/api/windows.storage.accesscache.storageapplicationpermissions.futureaccesslist) APIs. If you want to request approval to use the *broadFileSystemAccess* capability, then you must provide specific reasons as to why those APIs aren't sufficient for your needs.<br/><br/>**Note:** This capability is not supported on Xbox. |

| **Full Trust Permission Level** | This is the **runFullTrust** restricted capability. Terms are defined below, but in short, a package needs this capability if the package uses features for which full trust is needed. A common example is a package that contains one or more full-trust apps. The **runFullTrust** restricted capability allows a package like that to be installed on a machine.<br/><br/>A *full trust* app is one that sets `uap10:TrustLevel` to *mediumIL* (see the [Application](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-application) element). A full trust app has a process that runs with an integrity level of *medium* (see [Mandatory Integrity Control](/windows/win32/secauthz/mandatory-integrity-control)). And a *package* is an `.appx` or MSIX package (see [Building an MSIX package from your code](/windows/msix/desktop/source-code-overview)).<br/><br/>Another example where this capability is needed is a package with an extension category of *windows.firewallRules* (see [desktop2:Extension](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop2-package-extension)). That's considered a full-trust feature; and in that example there's no app to activate, and no process to launch.<br/><br/>To use the [FullTrustProcessLauncher class](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.fulltrustprocesslauncher), this capability is required, too. |
| **Elevation** | The **allowElevation** restricted capability allows apps that are created by Microsoft partners and enterprises to preserve existing desktop functionality that requires auto-elevation on launch or during an app's lifetime.<br/><br/>We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved. It will only be approved for line-of-business apps deployed by enterprises to their private store via the Microsoft Store for Business.  |
| **Windows Team Device Credentials** | The **teamEditionDeviceCredential** restricted capability allows apps to access APIs that request device account credentials on a Surface Hub device running Windows 10, version 1703 or later.<br/><br/>We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved. |
| **Windows Team Application View** | The **teamEditionView** restricted capability allows apps to access APIs for hosting an application view on a Surface Hub device running Windows 10, version 1703 or later.<br/><br/>We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved. |
| **Camera Processing Extension** | The **cameraProcessingExtension** restricted capability allows apps to process images captured from the camera without direct camera control.<br/><br/>This capability is required to call APIs in the [Windows.Devices.PointOfService.Provider](/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.provider) namespace.<br/><br/>Anyone may request access to this capability for store submission. |
| **Data usage Management** | The **networkDataUsageManagement** restricted capability allows apps to gather network data usage information.<br/><br/>This capability is required to call [GetAttributedNetworkUsageAsync](/uwp/api/windows.networking.connectivity.connectionprofile.getattributednetworkusageasync).<br/><br/>Anyone may request access to this capability for store submission. |
| **Manage phone line connectivity** | The **phoneLineTransportManagement** capability allows apps to manage system devices responsible for phone line connectivity.<br/><br/>This capability is required to use PhoneLineTransportDevice APIs in the [Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.calls) namespace. |
| **Unvirtualized Resources** | The **unvirtualizedResources** restricted capability enables your application to declare the [RegistryWriteVirtualization](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop6-registrywritevirtualization) and [FileSystemWriteVirtualization](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop6-filesystemwritevirtualization) elements in its package manifest to disable virtualization for the registry and file system. These declarations prevent the system from virtualizing any writes to HKEY_CURRENT_USER or to the user's AppData folder, respectively. This is useful in scenarios where your application expects other applications to read or write the same registry or file system entries as your application.<br/><br/>This capability is designed for certain types of desktop PC games that are published by Microsoft and our partners. It's also needed for apps packaged with external location (see [Grant package identity by packaging with external location](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/grant-identity-to-nonpackaged-apps)). It is not intended to be used for other scenarios, because it could compromise the system's ability to uninstall cleanly. |
| **Modifiable App** | The **modifiableApp** restricted capability enables your application to declare the [windows.mutablePackageDirectories](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop6-package-extension) extension in its package manifest. This enables you to provide a name for the folder where your application expects modified or added files to be located. The OS will create this folder and enable your application to use the files in this folder instead of (or in addition to) the files originally installed by the application.<br/><br/>This capability is designed for certain types of desktop PC games that are published by Microsoft and our partners. It will not be granted for other scenarios, because it can allow unsigned code to execute. |
| **Package Write Redirection Compatibility Shim** | The **packageWriteRedirectionCompatabilityShim** restricted capability configures your application to create all new files in a per-user location. Any preexisting files opened for writes are first copied into a per-user location and modifications happen to the file in that location. This capability is useful for applications that create or modify files in their installation folder.<br/><br/>This capability is designed for certain types of desktop PC games that are published by Microsoft and our partners. However, it might also be applicable to other apps in some cases. |
| **Custom Install Actions** | The **customInstallActions** restricted capability enables your application to declare the [windows.customInstall](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop6-package-extension) extension in its package manifest so that it can specify one or more additional installer files (.exe or .msi) that are executed with your application. This allows you to specify custom actions for any of the standard deployment scenarios: install, update, repair, or uninstall. For example, this is useful for applications that bundle a 3rd party redistributable component.<br/><br/>This capability is designed for certain types of desktop PC games that are published by Microsoft and our partners. It will not be granted for other scenarios. |
| **Packaged Services** | The **packagedServices** restricted capability allows applications that are created by Microsoft partners and enterprises to declare the [windows.service](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop6-extension) extension in its package manifest so that it can install one or more services along with the app. These services can be configured to run under the Local Service, Network Service or Local System accounts. Local Service and Network Service services only require the **packagedServices** capability. Local System services require both the **packagedServices** and **localSystemServices** capabilities.<br/><br/>We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved.  |
| **Local System Services** | The **localSystemServices** restricted capability allows applications that are created by Microsoft partners and enterprises to install one or more Local System services along with the app (that is, your application can declare the StartAccount for the services to be LocalSystem). This scenario also requires the **packagesServices** capability. <br/><br/>We don't recommend that you declare this capability in applications that you submit to the Microsoft Store. In most cases, the use of this capability won't be approved. |
| **Background Spatial Perception** | The **backgroundSpatialPerception** restricted capability allows an application to access the movement of the user's head, hands, motion controllers, and other tracked objects while the app is running in the background. |

## Custom capabilities

The [restricted capabilities](#restricted-capabilities) section above describes the same capability approval process that you can use to request approval to use a custom capability. The [embedded SIM](/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.esim) APIs are examples of APIs that require a custom capability. If you only want to run your application locally in developer mode, then you don't need the custom capability. But you need it to publish your app to the Microsoft Store, or to run it outside of developer mode.

If you have a Windows Technical Account Manager (TAM), then you can work with your TAM to request access. You can find more details at [Contact your Microsoft TAM](/windows-hardware/drivers/mobilebroadband/testing-your-desktop-cosa-apn-database-submission#contact-your-microsoft-tam).

To declare a custom capability, modify your [app package manifest](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/appx-package-manifest) source file (`Package.appxmanifest`). Add the **xmlns:uap4** XML namespace declaration, and use the **uap4** prefix when you declare your custom capability. Here's an example.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Package
    ...
    xmlns:uap4="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/4">
...
<Capabilities>
    <uap4:CustomCapability Name="CompanyName.customCapabilityName_PublisherID"/>
</Capabilities>
</Package>
```

> [!NOTE]
> All **CustomCapability** elements must come after any **Capability** elements and before any [DeviceCapability](#device-capabilities) elements under the **Capabilities** node in the package manifest.

| Capability scenario | Capability usage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **App URI handler** | An app can register itself as a handler for a given URI, such that when the user opens a link to the specified URI, the app is launched instead of opening the browser. That requires registration on the local machine, and verification by the target web server. The **Microsoft.delegatedWebFeatures_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability enables an app to host a Progressive Web App (PWA), and to verify that PWA as an app URI handler without referring to the target website for confirmation. |
| **Cellular SAR configuration** | The **Microsoft.cellularSARConfiguration_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability enables an app to perform configuration of a device's specific absorption rate (SAR) properties. See the [MobileBroadbandSarManager](/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.mobilebroadbandsarmanager) class. |
| **CoreApplication activation** | An app that declares the **Microsoft.coreAppActivation_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability is CoreApplication-based, but requires to run with full-trust, similar to a Desktop Bridge app. |
| **Custom install actions** | Enables the app to use custom install/uninstall actions. An app can use custom actions if it has the **customInstallActions** [restricted capability](#restricted-capabilities) AND (it is an MSIXVC Xbox Game Pass app, OR it has the **Microsoft.classicAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability). |
| **ESim management** | The **Microsoft.eSIMManagement_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability enables an app to perform configuration of a device's embedded SIM (eSIM). See the [ESim](/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.esim) class. |
| **Legacy install behaviors** | The **Microsoft.classicAppCompat_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability protects the case where an app declares a legacy install feature; for example, writing custom COM ProgIds in the Windows Registry. |
| **Machine-wide install** | Protects the case where an app declares a legacy install feature that's configured for machine-wide/HKLM registration, which requires-elevation. Specifically required for anything in the app's manifest where the app declares `Scope="machine"`.<br/><br/>For example, an MSIX-based app using the **desktop7:ApprovedShellExtension** element needs to set scope to machine, and therefore needs to declare the **Microsoft.classicAppCompatElevated_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability. For more info about that scenario, see [**desktop7:ApprovedShellExtension**](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop7-approvedshellextension). |
| **On-Demand Network** | The **Microsoft.onDemandHotspotControl_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability (the On-Demand Network capability) will be made available only to app developers building end-to-end Wi-Fi hotspot scenarios between a tethering-capable hardware device and a Windows PC. See the [WiFiOnDemandHotspotNetwork](/uwp/api/windows.devices.wifi.wifiondemandhotspotnetwork) class. |
| **Registering an approved shell extension** | See the **Machine-wide install** capability scenario. |
| **S-mode** | An app that declares the **Microsoft.requiresNonSMode_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability will be prevented from running on a Windows device in S-mode. |
| **Startup apps** | An app can be set up to start automatically at user login. Normally, the user can enable/disable that behavior for each app. The **Microsoft.nonUserConfigurableStartupTasks_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability configures an app such that the user can't enable/disable its startup behavior. |
| **Windows core 1** | An app that declares the **Microsoft.deployFullTrustOnHost_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability is fully-trusted to use native Win32 APIs on a Windows core device. |
| **Windows core 2** | A Desktop Bridge app that declares the **Microsoft.notSupportedInCoreV1_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability will be prevented from running on a Windows core device. |
| **Windows Hello companion device framework** | The functionality related to the **Microsoft.secondaryAuthenticationFactorForLogon_8wekyb3d8bbwe** custom capability is deprecated as of Windows 10, version 2004 (10.0; Build 19041), and we no longer grant this capability to developer accounts. An app that declares this capability can be registered with the companion device framework to enable *Windows unlock* with the app's associated companion device. For more info, see [Windows Unlock with Windows Hello companion (IoT) devices](../security/companion-device-unlock.md). |
